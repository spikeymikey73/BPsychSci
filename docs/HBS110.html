class="section level5">
<h5>Explain key perspectives on health, illness and disability,
including the biomedical and biopsychosocial models.</h5>
<p>Health is a term that has held different meanings for different
cultures, people, times in history, social classes and members of the
same family. The linguistic root of the word “Health” can be loosely
translated to mean “wholeness” in Anglo Saxon, suggesting an emphasis on
both physical and mental aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Mind-body relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stone Age: focus on
<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy-f.deakin.edu.au/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/trephination">trephination</a>,
where evil spirits are given an outlet from the body by making small
holes in the skull to alleviate illness.</li>
<li>Ancient Greece: Good health is attributed to the balance of bodily
fluids or “humours”:</li>
<li>Yellow bile (summer / hot-dry)</li>
<li>phlegm (winter / cold-wet)</li>
<li>blood (spring / wet-hot)</li>
<li>black bile (autumn / dry-cold)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hippocrates considered the mind and body as one unit attributing an
imbalance of the levels of humours in the body to illness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yellow bile (choleric / angry temperament)</li>
<li>phlegm (calm / phlegmatic)</li>
<li>blood (optimistic / sanguine)</li>
<li>black bile (sadness / melancholic)</li>
</ul>
<p>Healing involved the balance of these fluids through bleeding,
starvation, or diet/medicines, and the moderation of illness through
balance of body and mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ancient Rome: Galen also believed these fluids formed the basis
of physical and pathological health, linking the mind and body through
temperament and susceptibility to specific disease. For example: black
bile <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> melancholic <span
class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> breast cancer.</p></li>
<li><p>Middle Ages: Health in this era was attributed to spirituality,
with illness seen as punishment for misdeeds, or resulting from evil
spirits entering the soul. Priests were perceived to be in control of
people’s health, rather than the individual, having the ability to drive
out demons / illness.</p></li>
<li><p>Renaissance: The advent of scholastic and scientific discovery
driving a more sophisticated understanding of physiology with little to
no exploration of psychological understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>17th Century: saw the advent of
<abbr title="mind and body were considered separate entities having little to no relationship with each other">dualism</abbr>.
The body was viewed as a machine (investigated by physicians), with
material purpose and functions that comprised of the brain, heart and
cells. The mind was seen as non-material (investigated by theologians),
and was comprised of thoughts and feelings, which were considered unable
to be investigated and understood. Autopsy was deemed acceptable by the
church as the soul had left the body after death, opening he way for
anatomical research and medical understanding. This period is further
characterised by the
<abbr title="views of the body as a machine, with illness understood as a response to biological and physiological processes">mechanistic</abbr>
viewpoint due to the growth in understanding of knowledge of cells
rather than the humours.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Biomedical model of illness (Reductionism /
Dualism)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assumes that all illness is a result of an underlying physical
cause, curable through medical intervention.</li>
<li>Removal of the underlying cause will restore health as a result of
medical intervention.</li>
<li>Assumes that mind, body and behaviour can all be explained through
cell, neural and biochemical activity.</li>
<li>Ignores the differences of individuals in reacting to disease
through the influence of personality, cognition, social support or
cultural beliefs.</li>
<li>Indigenous Australian cultures generally attribute the cause of
illness as a resultof social and spiritual dysfunction (i.e. - not
meeting one’s obligations to society or land).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Biopsychosocial models of health and illness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recognises the connection of the objective and subjective, or the
relationship between underlying organic causes of disease and the
individual responses determined by the mind. Examples of this connection
includes such things as the placebo effect, and phantom limb pain in
amputees.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>biopsychsocial model <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>
biomedical  model <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> social,
cultural  and  psychological  factors</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Challenging Dualism: Psychosocial Models of Health &amp;
Illness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The discovery and exploration of the Biopsychosocial Model weakened
the Descartian theory of dualism</li>
<li>The Biopsychosocial model reinforced the theories of Freud in his
exploration of the conscious and unconscious mind concepts.</li>
<li>Freud’s theories leading to the development of psychosomatic
medicine.</li>
<li>Mind <span class="math inline">\(\Leftrightarrow\)</span> Body
relationships</li>
<li>The biopsychosocial model offers a multivariate and comprehensive
model to explain illness and its effects on us.</li>

<h5>Classify factors that influence health status.</h5>
<p>Rene Dubos (1968) defined wellness as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A quality of life, involving social, emotional, mental, spiritual
and biological fitness on the part of the individual, which result from
adaptations to the environment”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept of wellness later extended Dubos’ definition of health
and the continuum beyond the neutral point.</p>

<strong>Behaviour and Health</strong>

<li>Advances and study of medicine and health have lead to increased
longevity in Western cultures from 55 years in 1900 to 80.3 (male) and
85.2 (female) in 2014.</li>
<li>Indigenous Australian life expectancy is around 10 years lower,
generally as a result of lifestyle and diet.</li>
<li>Deaths 100 years ago were primarily influenced by disease and
infection, while currently are mostly attributed to lifestyle behaviours
and habits.</li>
<li>The
<abbr title="Refers to the number of new cases of a particular disease in a given period of time">incidence</abbr>
of deaths through these behavioural contingencies is slowly diminishing
as a result of public health campaigns and education.</li>
<li>The incidence of diabetes, however, has nearly doubled since 1981,
growing faster than any other cause.</li>
<li>The
<abbr title="The number of established cases of a particular disease within the population at a given time.">prevalence</abbr>
of HIV/AIDS and other diseases have dropped as a result of improved
diagnosis/treatment methods.</li>
<li>Doctors were once considered advisors to the wealthy in moderating
health behaviours, as well as our “fitness to work”.</li>
<li>The unintended harm of some Western treatments has also given rise
to the popularity of alternate treatment/medicines.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Cross-cultural Perspectives on Health</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>What is considered to be ‘normal’ (health belief systems, health
attributions and health practices) varies across cultures and is a
result of the economic, political and cultural climate of the era in
which a person lives.</li>
<li>The stigma associated with some illnesses in South Asian regions can
effect the families social standing, or a sibling’s suitability for
marriage.</li>
<li>Excessive alcohol consumption and abuse is no longer seen as a
deviant behaviour, but an illness requiring treatment</li>
<li>Smoking is no longer seen as glamorous or desirable.</li>
<li>Western cultures tend to have allocated professionals who look after
the mind, body and soul, whereas some Indigenous Australian and Eastern
cultures have a more holistic view of all facets of our lives.</li>
<li>Some sections of Indian culture view illness as punishment for past
sins, having profound effect on the ability to care for these
individuals and arrange appropriate treatments</li>
<li>This
<abbr title="Cultural philosophy that emphasises the individual as part of a wider unit and places emphasis on actions motivated by collective, rather than individual, needs and wants">collectivist</abbr>
approach to staying healthy and avoiding illness is far different from
our <abbr title="cultural philosophy that places
responsibility at the feet of the individual; thus behaviour is often driven by individual needs and wants rather than by community needs or wants.">individualistic</abbr>
approach to health (consider how long the passive smoking evidence was
ignored).</li>

<h5>Describe the influence of life stage, culture and health status on
health.</h5>
<p><strong>Developmental Theories</strong></p>
<p>The developmental process is a function of the interaction between
three factors: 1. Learning: a relatively permanent change in knowledge,
skill or ability as a result of experience; 2. Experience: what we do,
see, hear, feel, think; 3. Maturation: thought, behaviour or physical
growth, attributed to a genetically determined sequence of development
and ageing rather than to experience.</p>

different dimensions, including:</p>

<li>cognitive and intellectual functioning</li>
<li>language and communication skills</li>
<li>the understanding of illness</li>
<li>healthcare and maintenance behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Individual perceptions of health or illness may differ depending on
the developmental stage of the individual and their specific needs. The
ability of the individual (in the case of children, for example) to have
their basic needs met can also be impaired as a result of age, accident,
or illness.</p>
<p><strong>Piaget</strong></p>
<p>Piaget proposed a staged structure to which, he considered, all
individuals follow in sequence as below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Sensorimotor</strong> (birth–2 years): an infant understands
the world through sensations and movement, but lacks symbolic thought
and moves from reflexive to voluntary action. egocentric</li>
<li><strong>Pre-operational</strong> (2–7 years): symbolic thought
develops by around age 2, thereafter simple logical thinking and
language develop, generally
<abbr title="self-centred, such as in the pre-operational stage (age 2–7 years) of children, when they see things only from their own perspective">egocentric</abbr>.</li>
<li><strong>Concrete operational</strong> (7–11 years): abstract thought
and logic develop hugely; can perform mental operations (e.g. mental
arithmetic) and manipulate objects.</li>
<li><strong>Formal operational</strong> (age 12 to adulthood): abstract
thought and imagination develop as does deductive reasoning. Not
everyone may attain this level.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sensorimotor and Pre-Operational Stage Children</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Possessing an undeveloped ability to empathise with others who are
unwell</li>
<li>Inability to understand their effect on the world around them
through imitation and learning</li>
<li>Illness and health is considered black and white (no in
between)</li>
</ul>
<p>Under-7s generally explain illness on a ‘magical’ level, with
explanations based on association:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incomprehension</strong>: child gives irrelevant answers or
evades the question (e.g. sun causes heart attacks).</li>
<li><strong>Phenomenonism</strong>: illness is usually a sign or sound
that the child has at some time associated with the illness, but with
little grasp of cause and effect (e.g. a cold is when you sniff a
lot).</li>
<li><strong>Contagion</strong>: illness is usually from a person or
object that is close by, but not necessarily touching the child; or it
can be attributed to an activity that occurred before the illness (e.g.:
‘You get measles from people’. If asked how? ‘Just by walking near
them’).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concrete Operational Stage Children</strong></p>
<p>Children over 7 are described by Piaget as capable of thinking
logically about objects and events, although they are still unable to
distinguish between mind and body until around age 11, when adolescence
begins.</p>
<p>The concept of illness at around 8 to 11 years is more concrete and
based on a causal sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contamination</strong>: children at this stage understand
that illness can have multiple symptoms, and they recognise that germs,
or even their own behaviour, can cause illness (e.g. ‘You get a cold if
you get sneezed on, and it gets into your body’).</li>
<li><strong>Internalisation</strong>: illness is within the body, and
the process by which symptoms occur can be partially understood. The
cause of a cold may come from outside germs that are inhaled or
swallowed and then enter the bloodstream. These children can
differentiate between body organs and function and can understand
specific, simple information about their illness. They can also see the
role of treatment and/or personal action as returning them to
health.</li>
<li>Medical staff are still seen as having absolute authority, but their
actions might be criticised/avoided (e.g. reluctance to give blood,
accusations of hurting unnecessarily, etc. may appear as children can
now begin to weigh up the pros and cons of actions).</li>
<li>Children can be encouraged to take some personal control over their
illness or treatment at this stage in development which can help the
child to cope.</li>
<li>They also need to be encouraged to express their fears.</li>
<li>Parents need to strike a balance between monitoring a sick child’s
health and behaviour and being overprotective, as this can detrimentally
affect a child’s social, cognitive and personal development and may
encourage feelings of dependency and disability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adolescence and formal operational thought</strong></p>
<p>During early adolescence (11–13 years), as individuals prepare for
increased autonomy, independence and peers take on more credence than
parents, much of life’s health-damaging behaviour commences
(e.g. smoking).</p>
<p>Illness concepts at this stage are condsidered as being at an
abstract level, based on interactions between the person and their
environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physiological</strong>: children now reach a stage of
physiological understanding where most can define illness in terms of
specific bodily organs or functions (e.g. germs cause white blood cells
to become active to try and fight them), and begin to appreciate
multiple physical causes (e.g. genes plus pollution plus
behaviour).</li>
<li><strong>Psychophysiological</strong>: in later adolescence (from
around 14 years) and in adulthood, many people grasp the idea that the
mind and body interact, and understand or accept the role of stress,
worry and so on, in the exacerbation and even the cause of illness.
However, many people of all ages fail to achieve this level of
understanding about illness and continue to use more cognitively
simplistic explanations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adulthood 17∕18+</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Early adulthood blends out of adolescence as the person forges their
identity and assumes the roles and responsibility of adulthood—a time of
consolidation.</li>
<li>Adults are less likely than adolescents to adopt new health-risk
behaviour and are generally more likely to engage in protective
behaviour.</li>
<li>Marriage was found to benefit health in men, that is they have lower
illness scores than men living alone—whereas for women, such results are
not comprehensive.</li>
<li>While early adulthood is generally viewed positively, middle age has
been identified as a period of doubts and anxiety, reappraisal and
change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ageing and health</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The United Nations Secretariat (2002) has predicted an increase in
those aged over 60 from 10% of the world population to 20% by 2050</li>
<li>Not all elderly people are ill or infirm, but even among the
minority who go on without chronic health problems (physical and/or
mental), episodes of acute illness are commonplace.</li>
<li>Empirical research has shown that
<abbr title="conscious thoughts and beliefs about yourself that allow you to feel you are distinct from others and that you exist as a separate person.">self-concept</abbr>
is relatively stable through ageing and that changes in self-concept are
not an inevitable part of the ageing process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Successful ageing</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Biomedical model</strong>: based on physical and psychiatric
functioning, diagnoses and functional ability.</li>
<li><strong>Broader biomedical model</strong>: as above but includes
social engagement and activity.</li>
<li><strong>Social functioning model</strong>: based on the nature and
frequency of social functioning and networks, social support
accessed.</li>
<li><strong>Psychological resources model</strong>: based on personal
characteristics of optimism and self-efficacy and on sense of purpose,
coping and problem-solving, self-confidence and self-worth.</li>
<li><strong>Lay model</strong>: based on the above variables plus
socioeconomic variables of income and ‘perceived social capital’, which
included access to resources and facilities, environmental quality and
problems (e.g. crime, traffic, pollution, places to walk, feelings of
safety).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although each model could independently predict
<abbr title="Quality of Life">QoL</abbr>, the strongest prediction was
achieved by the lay model.</li>
<li>Such findings highlight the importance of multidimensional models of
health in that medical or psychological or social variables are all
important, but a more holistic model is ‘better’.</li>

<h5>Identify a range of important influences on the domains of
health.</h5>
<p>Baumann (1961) conducted a study on meaning of being healthy amongst
a group of people who had been diagnosed with quite serious illness,
gave three types of response:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><abbr title="being">feeling (a general sense of
wellbeing)</abbr></p></li>
<li><p><abbr title="having">symptom orientation (the absence of symptoms
and disease)</abbr></p></li>

are able to do when physically fit)</abbr></p></li>
<li><p>Our current health status influences our subjective belief of
healthy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elderly people view their subjective health in terms of physical
function and the ability to perform ADLs (doing)</li>
<li>Those in good health tend to express more positive indicators or
about health, such as being able to exercise, or being happy)
(feelings)</li>
<li>Those in poor health reflect on symptoms and indicators of poor
health (having)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The Health &amp; Lifestyles Survey (1993) further identified a
broader range of characteristics linked to health as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asked participants to reflect on their own health and that of
someone else,</li>
<li>A small group of young males were unable to describe what it meant
to be healthy</li>
<li>A smaller group of older women were unable to recall what it felt
like to be healthy</li>
<li>Identified the following general categories:
<ul>
<li>Health as not ill (no symptoms, no visits to the doctor)</li>
<li>Health as reserve (having come from a strong family, recovering
quickly from illness or surgery)</li>
<li>Health as Physical fitness and vitality (usually applied to
observations of others, young men ‘feeling fit’, young women ‘feeling
full of vitality’)</li>
<li>Health as Psychosocial wellbeing (a person’s overall mental
state)</li>
<li>Health as function (the ability to fulfill one’s normal social
roles)</li>

<h4>What Is Health Behaviour?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Any activity undertaken by a person believing themselves to be
healthy for the purposes of preventing disease, or detecting it at an
asymptomatic stage’</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Definition by Kasl &amp; Cobb (1966) did not account for exercise,
weight control, appearance, or maintaining social contacts.</li>
<li>Engaging in health behaviours may still prevent disease</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>‘…behaviour performed by an individual regardless of his/her
perceived health status, with the purpose of protecting, promoting, or
maintaining his/her health.’</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Definition by Harris &amp; Guten (1979) includes the behaviours of
unhealthy people, such as a person with heart disease exercising to
prevent progression of the disease.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Behavioural Pathogens</strong>: A behavioural practise
considered damaging to our health (e.g. smoking). <strong>Behavioural
Immunogen</strong>: A health protective behavioural practise such as
exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>The development of medical understanding has changed our
perspectives on health behaviour (e.g. smoking, drinking, exercise, sun
exposure)</li>
<li>A longitudinal study conducted from 1963 - 1999 has determined the
key behavioural factors associated with longevity:
<ul>
<li>Sleeping 7 - 8 hours a night</li>
<li>Not Smoking</li>
<li>Consuming 1 - 2 alcoholic drinks per week (or less)</li>
<li>Regular Exercise</li>
<li>Not eating between meals</li>
<li>Eating Breakfast</li>
<li>Being no more than 10% overweight.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Men and women performing 6 out of the 7 of these behaviours, live an
additional 7 and 11 years respectively than those performing less than
6.</li>
<li>Not snacking or not eating breakfast was later shown to have no
bearing on longevity.</li>
<li>To truly understand health behaviours, we also need to understand
the psychological and social factors contributing to the adoption or
avoidance of health behaviours.</li>

<h4>Distal Influences on Health Behaviour</h4>
<ul>
<li>Distal (away from the body) influences on behaviour (such as
culture, environment, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, gender and
personality) indirectly impact our health behaviours through proximal
factors (beliefs, attitudes and goals).</li>

<h5>Demographic Influences</h5>
<ul>
<li>Highest amount of heath behaviour change evident in late teens,
early adulthood where we take on the habits of peers (as well as
siblings) rather than parents or other adults.</li>
<li>Markers if higher risk taking, taking up smoking or drinking, and
initiating ‘risk’ behaviours.</li>
<li>Gender can also be a marker of particular health risks or benefits
(such as men avoiding seeing their doctor), with men more likely to
engage in health risk behaviours than women.</li>
<li>Exercise can be a demonstration of increased health promoting
behaviours, which can also serve as a way of mitigating the negative
judgements of other men while not drinking as much.</li>

the general absence of support from medical health professionals in
encouraging and supporting men in seeking assistance.</li>

<li><p>Health risk taking behaviour has been observed as high in those
who test high in extroversion, neuroticism and openness.</p></li>
<li><p>Health promoting factors are evident in those scoring high on the
agreeable and conscientiousness scales.</p></li>
<li><p>High levels of neuroticism have also been linked to greater use
of healthcare. Highly neurotic individuals are more likely to pay
greater attention to bodily sensations.</p></li>

<p><strong>Other aspects of Personality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Locus of Control (LoC)
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong>: placing responsibility of outcomes on
themselves, and consider that their actions effect outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>External</strong>: place responsibility of outcomes on
external factors such as luck.</li>
<li>A multidimensional health locus of control which identifies three
independent dimensions:</li>
<li><strong>Internal</strong>: Strong internal beliefs in which the
individual considers themselves as the primary determinant of their
health state. Often associated with high levels of health protective
behaviours and self-efficacy (Bandura)</li>
<li><strong>External</strong>: Heavily reliant on luck, fate or chance
as a health determinant, rather than own behaviour.</li>
<li><strong>Powerful Others</strong>: consider the actions of health
professionals to be strong determinants of our own health status.</li>

<strong>Define Addiction</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><em>Addiction</em> can be defined as the ongoing interaction with a
harmful substance or activity, regardless of the ongoing negative
effects.</li>
<li>The APA classifies addiction as a mental disorder.</li>
<li>Substances or behaviours are considered to be addictive if they have
the potential to induce euphoria, mood changes, a reduction in anxiety
or reduce pain.</li>
<li>People with a <em>physiological dependence</em> on a substance or
behaviour experience greater <em>tolerance</em> through ongoing
use/exposure, and <em>withdrawal</em> in attempting to cease use.</li>
<li>A <em>Psychological dependence</em> can develop with respect to
behaviours such as gambling, sex and working. These are said to create a
change at the cellular level, along with mood changes.</li>
<li>All forms of addiction are considered to effect dysfunction of
certain biochemical systems in the brain at the synaptic level.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Signs of Addiction</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>While our brains are wired to respond to reinforcing behaviours (as
well as moderating these) for sustaining our lives, addiction is
identified through characteristics that might highlight our inability to
moderate:
<ul>
<li><strong>Compulsion:</strong> An overwhelming compulsion to engage in
a behaviour.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Control:</strong> An inability to predict the harm
or benefit of an isolated behaviour.</li>
<li><strong>Negative Consequences:</strong> Physical damage,
legal/financial trouble, academic failure or family estrangement.</li>
<li><strong>Denial:</strong> The inability to recognise harm/s
caused.</li>
<li><strong>Inability to abstain:</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>These characteristics are present regardless of whether the
addiction is substance or behaviour related.</li>
<li>A common concept of addiction known as <em>nurturing through
avoidance</em> is the need to avoid unpleasant feelings or situations
through the use of substances or behaviours.</li>
<li>This maladaptive coping mechanism increasingly damages our bodies
and/or relationships to the point where escape becomes a “safe”
option.</li>
<li><em>Harmful use</em> relates to the physical damage (disease) or
mental (mood disorders) caused by a substance or behaviour.</li>
<li><em>Dependence Syndrome</em> refers to a cluster of physiological,
behavioural and cognitive phenomena in which the use of a substance
takes on a much higher priority for a given individual than other
behaviours that once had greater value. Dependence can be both
physiological (tolerance and/or withdrawal) and psychological (impaired
control over use).</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Impact on Family and Friends</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Family members of an addict can often enter into a
<em>codependent</em> relationship, where they put their own needs aside
to aid the addict, operating in crisis mode, unable to set emotional
boundaries between themselves and the addicted family member. Therapists
often attempt to highlight this relationship to clients as part of
treatment.</li>
<li><em>Enablers</em> unconsciously protect a family member from the
consequences of their behaviour and prevent them from seeing the effects
of their behaviour.</li>

class="section level5">
<h5>Describe types of process addictions, such as gambling disorder,
exercise addiction, technology addictions, and compulsive buying
disorder.</h5>
<p><em>Process addictions</em> are behaviours (as opposed to substances)
that are known to be addictive as they are mood altering.</p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Gambling Disorder</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Characteristic behaviours include a preoccupation with gambling,
unsuccessful efforts to cut back or quit, gambling when feeling
distressed, and lying to family members to conceal the extent of
gambling.</li>
<li>A gambling addiction typically progresses through four phases:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The winning phase often begins with a large win, which reinforces
the excitement and reward associated with gambling. The gambler begins
to feel as though he or she cannot lose.</li>
<li>In the losing phase, gamblers become preoccupied with gambling,
trying to win back what they have lost. This often interferes with work
and family life.</li>
<li>In the desperate phase, gamblers lose the ability to control their
gambling. They feel ashamed and guilty but cannot stop. They may resort
to stealing or cheating to continue their gambling.</li>
<li>In the hopeless phase, gamblers give up the hope of quitting. They
don’t believe that anyone cares or that help is possible</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Gambling has a biological component, where it is considered a
disorder of the dopamine neurotransmitter system coupled with decreased
blood flow to a key section of the brain’s reward system.</li>
<li>Gamblers may compensate for this dysfunctional reward system through
the activity, showing elements of tolerance and withdrawal.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Compulsive Buying Disorder</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Compulsive buyers excessively shop and spend, with poor impulse
control.</li>
<li>Symptoms include:
<ul>
<li>a preoccupation with shopping and spending,</li>
<li>buying multiples of the same item,</li>
<li>shopping for longer than intended,</li>
<li>repeatedly buying much more than the person needs or can
afford,</li>
<li>buying that interferes with social activities/work, and</li>
<li>creates financial problems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compulsive buying frequently results in psychological distress as
well as conflict with friends and between couples.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Exercise Addiction</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Exercise used as a method of meeting needs for nurturance, intimacy,
self-esteem, and self-competency.</li>
<li>Addictive or compulsive exercise results in alienation, injuries,
and a craving for more.</li>
<li>Warning signs include:
<ul>
<li>Injuring and reinjuring the body</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>Feeling restless</li>
<li>Adhering to a rigid workout plan</li>
<li>Becoming fixated on burning calories or losing weight</li>
<li>Cancelling social plans</li>
<li>Skipping work/missing class, and</li>
<li>Working out beyond the point of pain</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Technology Addictions</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Some online activities, such as gaming, social media and cybersex,
seem to be more potentially addictive than others.</li>
<li>Internet addicts typically exhibit symptoms such as:
<ul>
<li>General disregard for their health</li>
<li>Sleep deprivation,</li>
<li>Neglecting family and friends</li>
<li>Lack of physical activity</li>
<li>Euphoria when online</li>
<li>Low grades, and</li>
<li>Poor job performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>May be a compensation for loneliness, marital or work problems, an
unsatisfying social life, or financial problems.</li>

<h5>Identify the six categories of drugs and their routes of
administration.</h5>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Prescription drugs:</strong> Prescription drugs can be
obtained only with a prescription from a licensed health
practitioner.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Over-the-counter drugs:</strong> are available without a
prescription, and create substantial savings for the health care system
through decreased visits to health care providers and decreased use of
prescription medications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recreational drugs:</strong> Used to relax or socialise.
Alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine products are included in this category,
and are legal even though they are psychoactive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Herbal preparations:</strong> Herbal preparations include
teas and other products of botanical origin, being believed to have
medicinal properties.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Illicit (illegal) drugs:</strong> Although laws governing
their use, possession, cultivation, manufacture, and sale differ from
state to state, illicit drugs are generally recognised as harmful. All
are psychoactive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commercial drugs:</strong> Commercial drugs are those
found in commercially sold products such as perfumes, cosmetics,
house-hold cleaners, paints, glues, inks, dyes, and pesticides.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pleasure Circuit:</strong> Known as the <em>mesolimbic
dopamine system</em>, the pleasure circuit links the brain stem (motor
functions), the limbic system (emotions), and frontal cerebral cortex
(memory, perception, thought, and consciousness).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Dopamine</em> is the <strong>neurotransmitter</strong>
(chemical used to transmit signals between neurons), with all addictive
drugs affecting chemical neurotransmission by enhancing, suppressing, or
interfering with it through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mimicking the effects of natural neurotransmitters.</li>
<li>Blocking receptors and thereby prevent neuronal transmission.</li>
<li>Blocking the reuptake of neurotransmitters by neurons (which
increases the concentration of the neurotransmitters in the synaptic
gap).</li>
<li>Causing neurotransmitters to be released in greater amounts than
normal.</li>
</ul></li>

<p></br></p>
<p><strong>Routes of Administration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Route of administration refers to the way a given drug is taken into
the body.
<ul>
<li><strong>Oral ingestion:</strong> swallowing a tablet, capsule, or
liquid. (<span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 30 minutes to
reach bloodstream).</li>
<li><strong>Inhalation:</strong> Sniffing, smoking, or inhaling. (Most
rapid method of administration).</li>
<li><strong>Injection:</strong> Into the bloodstream
(<em>intra-venous</em>), a muscle (<em>Intramuscular</em>), or just
under the skin (<em>subcutaneous</em>). IV injection is the most common
method of injection due to rapid ingestion speed (within seconds). Also
the most dangerous method, due to risk of damage to blood vessels and
blood bourne disease (HIV, Hepatitis).</li>
<li><strong>Transdermal:</strong> Absorbed through the skin
(i.e. Nicotine patch) or internal tissues. Examples include mucous
membranes in the nose (<em>snorting</em>), or in the vagina or anus
(<em>suppositories</em>). Suppositories are typically mixed with a waxy
medium that melts at body temperature, releasing the drug into the
bloodstream.</li>

<h5>Review problems relating to the misuse and abuse of prescription
drugs, including the use of illicit drugs.</h5>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Non-medical use or abuse of prescription drugs</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The common misconception of lower life expectancy has been
attributed to the use of illicit drugs, however, alcohol, smoking or
lower rates of physical inactivity has been shown to have more impact on
our life expectancy.</li>
<li>Approximately 40 deaths per million of the population aged between
15 and 64 were attributed to illicit drug use in 2012.</li>
<li>The illicit use of drugs (some legally obtained, e.g. valium, some
not, e.g. heroin) can cause anxiety in teachers, parents, the police,
the government and in young people them-selves.</li>
<li>Stigmatisation of certain drugs in Australia has led to under
reporting, which has consequences for epidemiological studies and
treatment policies.</li>
<li>The method of ingestion, has led people to associate some forms of
drug use (i.e. injecting drug use) with serious diseases including HIV
and Hepatitis C.</li>
<li>It is estimated that approximately 12.7 million people inject drugs,
with around 13% of this group have an HIV diagnosis.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Use and abuse of illicit drugs</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>We may use illicit substances ourselves, watch someone we love
struggle with drug abuse, or become the victim of a drug-related
crime.</li>
<li>We pay increasing taxes for law enforcement and drug
rehabilitation.</li>
<li>When our co-workers use drugs, the effectiveness of our own work may
be diminished.</li>
<li>Illicit drug use spans all age groups, genders, ethnicities,
occupations, and socio-economic groups.</li>
<li>Illicit drug use peaked around 25 million users between 1979 and
1986, declined until 1992, rose up to around 27 million users per year,
and has remained stable over the past several decades.</li>
<li>Among youth, however, illicit drug use, notably of marijuana and
heroin, has been rising in recent years.</li>
<li>Compared to alcohol and tobacco, illicit drug use is low.</li>
<li>For all Australians aged 14 and above, 43% had used an illicit drug
in their lifetime and approximately 15% had used illicit drugs in the
previous 12 months.</li>
<li>The top four most prevalent were cannabis, ecstasy,
meth/amphetamines and cocaine.</li>
<li>Between 3.5% and 7% of the world’s population will have used an
illicit drug in the past year, with regular drug use tending to relate
to cannabis use, whereas dependent or problematic use, classed as a drug
abuse disorder, tends to correspond to opiate use.</li>
<li>About 0.25% percent will have injected across the global
population.</li>
<li>Even cannabis, which is ‘top’ of the list of illicit drugs used, has
a relatively low prevalence in terms of use ‘in the past year’
(7.6%).</li>

<h5>Discuss the use and abuse of controlled substances, including
stimulants, marijuana and other cannabinoids, depressants, opioids
(narcotics), hallucinogens, inhalants, and anabolic steroids.</h5>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Stimulant</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>A stimulant is a drug that increases activity of the central nervous
system. Its effects usually involve increased activity, anxiety, and
agitation; users often seem jittery or nervous while high. Commonly used
illegal stimulants include cocaine, amphetamines, and methamphetamine.
Legal stimulants include caffeine and nicotine.</li>
<li>Although archaeological evidence documents the use of
<strong>marijuana</strong> as far back as 6000 years ago, the drug did
not become popular in the United States until the 1960s. Recent use of
marijuana is also more likely to have occurred for males (13.4%) than
females (8.3%). A survey of Australian secondary school students by the
Australian Secondary Students’ Alcohol and Drug Survey (ASSAD) reported
that in 12 to 17 year old students, 16% reported ever having used
marijuana, with 7% using within the previous month.</li>
<li>Whereas central nervous system stimulants increase muscular and
nervous system activity, <strong>depressants</strong> have the opposite
effect. These drugs slow down neuromuscular activity and cause
sleepiness or calmness. If the dose is high enough, brain function can
stop, causing death. Alcohol is the most widely used central nervous
system depressant. Other depressants are benzodiazepines, barbiturates,
and GHB.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Narcotics</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narcotics</strong> cause drowsiness, relieve pain, and
produce euphoria.</li>
<li>Opioids are derived from the parent drug opium, a dark, resinous
substance made from the milky juice of the opium poppy seed, and they
are all highly addictive.</li>
<li>Opium and heroin are both illegal in the United States, but some
opioids are available by prescription for medical purposes.</li>
<li>Morphine is sometimes prescribed for severe pain, and codeine is
found in prescription cough syrups and other painkillers.</li>
<li>Several prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Percodan, OxyContin,
Demerol, and Dilaudid, contain synthetic opioids.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Hallucinogens</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hallucinogens</strong>, or <strong>psychedelics</strong>,
are substances that are capable of creating auditory or visual
hallucinations and unusual changes in mood, thoughts, and feelings.</li>
<li>The major receptor sites for most of these drugs are in the
reticular formation (located in the brain stem at the upper end of the
spinal cord), which is responsible for interpreting outside stimuli
before allowing these signals to travel to other parts of the
brain.</li>
<li>When a hallucinogen is present at a reticular formation site,
sensory input becomes scrambled, and the user may see wavy walls instead
of straight ones or may ‘smell’ colours and ‘hear’ tastes. This mixing
of sensory messages is known as <strong>synesthesia</strong>.</li>
<li>Users may also become less inhibited or may recall events long
buried in the subconscious mind.</li>
<li>The most widely recognised hallucinogens are LSD, ecstasy, PCP,
mescaline, psilocybin, and ketamine.</li>
<li>All are illegal and carry severe penalties for manufacture,
possession, transportation, or sale.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Inhalants</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inhalants</strong> are chemicals whose vapours, when
inhaled, can cause hallucinations and create intoxicating and euphoric
effects.</li>
<li>Not commonly recognised as drugs, inhalants are legal to purchase
and widely available but dangerous.</li>
<li>They generally appeal to young people who can’t afford or obtain
illicit substances.</li>
<li>Some misused products include rubber cement, model glue, paint
thinner, aerosol sprays, lighter fluid, varnish, wax, spot removers, and
petrol.</li>
<li>Most of these substances are sniffed or ‘huffed’ by users in search
of a quick, cheap high.</li>
<li>Amyl nitrite, a vasodilator, and nitrous oxide (‘laughing gas’), an
anaesthetic, are also sometimes abused.</li>
<li>Because they are inhaled, the volatile chemicals in these products
reach the bloodstream within seconds.</li>
<li>This characteristic, along with the fact that dosages are extremely
difficult to control because everyone has unique lung and breathing
capacities, makes inhalants particularly dangerous.</li>
<li>The effects of inhalants resemble those of central nervous system
depressants: dizziness, disorientation, impaired coordination, reduced
judgment, and slowed reaction times.</li>
<li>An overdose of fumes from inhalants can cause unconsciousness and
even death.</li>
<li>Because the effect lasts only a few minutes, users may continue to
inhale over several hours; this can lead to loss of consciousness and
death.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Inhalants</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anabolic steroids</strong> are artificial forms of the male
hormone testosterone that promote muscle growth and strength.</li>
<li>Steroids are available in two forms: injectable solutions and
pills.</li>
<li>Ergogenic drugs are used primarily by people who believe that the
drugs will increase their strength, power, bulk (weight), speed, and
athletic performance.</li>
<li>It was once estimated that up to 20 percent of college athletes used
steroids.</li>
<li>Now that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has
instituted stricter drug-testing policies, reported use of anabolic
steroids among intercollegiate athletes has decreased.</li>
<li>In 2014, fewer than half of 1 percent of college athletes surveyed
reported use of anabolic steroids within the past 12 months.</li>
<li>Those who reported using anabolic steroids used them less than once
per week.</li>
<li>Of those, half reported that their first experience with anabolic
steroids occurred after the age of 18.</li>
<li>The perceived use of anabolic steroid on college campuses is much
higher than reality.</li>
<li>In a 2014 survey, fewer than 1 percent of students reported using
them within the past 30 days.</li>

<strong>Detoxification</strong>
</summary>
<p>Detoxification refers to an early abstinence period during which an
addict adjusts physically and cognitively to being free from the
addiction’s influence.</p>
Scientific research has shown that treatment can help addicts recover
from their addiction. The Surgeon General’s Report on Alcohol, Drugs and
Health (2016) identified key findings that support the effectiveness of
treatment interventions, therapies, services and medications for
substance abuse disorders. Some of these findings are as follows: -
Substance abuse disorders can be treated effectively, with reoccurrence
rates no higher than those for other chronic diseases such as diabetes,
asthma, and hypertension. - Substance abuse disorders can be easily
identified in clinical settings through brief conversations with a
health care provider and other interventions. - Treatment for substance
abuse disorders is less costly in the long run than no treatment. -
Behavioural therapies can be effective in treating substance abuse
disorders. - Medications can be effective in treating serious substance
abuse disorders but are often underutilised. - Treatment recovery
programs can include: - 12 step programs - Recovery coaching - Social,
recreational and social media support systems - Vaccines against
addictive drugs - Other pharmacological treatments (methadone
replacement, Naltrexone (Antagonist), buprenorphine (Temgesic))

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Chemistry &amp; Potency of Alcohol</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The intoxicating substance in beer, wine, etc is ethanol (ethyl
alcohol), and is produced through fermentation, where yeast organisms
break down plant sugars to produce ethanol and CO<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>.</li>
<li>Hard liquor is then distilled where alcohol vapours are condensed
and mixed with water.</li>
<li>The proof of a beverage is a measure of the alcohol content:
<ul>
<li>80 proof whiskey, 40% alcohol by volume</li>
<li>100 proof vodka, 50% alcohol by volume</li>
<li>most wines are 12 - 15% alcohol by volume</li>
<li>most beers are 2 - 7% alcohol by volume</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A standard drink is a beverage containing 10% (around 12.4ml) of
pure alcohol. (i.e. a 375ml mid-strength beer contains the same amount
of alcohol as a 30ml shot of vodka)</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Absorption and Metabolism</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol molecules are small enough to be absorbed through the
stomach lining (20%) or small intestine (80%). Food requires breaking
down before absorption can take place.</li>
<li>Factors influencing absorption:
<ul>
<li>Alcoholic concentration in drink,</li>
<li>Amount of alcohol consumed</li>
<li>Amount of food in stomach (reducing surface area available to absorb
alcohol)</li>
<li>Your metabolism/weight/mood</li>
<li>Carbonated drinks are absorbed more quickly (induced pyloric
valve/sphincter to open), as it is released to the small intestine more
quickly.</li>
<li>In higher concentrations of alcohol the pyloric valve can spasm
causing the sphincter to remain closed, extending time for absorption,
and in order to induce vomiting.</li>
<li>Food in the stomach also extends the time of absorption: the pyloric
valve remains closed to aid digestion, and the available surface area of
the stomach lining (for absorption) is reduced.</li>
<li>Alcohol can be absorbed more readily when stressed or tense as the
stomach contents are released to the small intestine more often.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream:
<ul>
<li>It circulates the body until it is metabolised in the liver,</li>
<li>Converted by the liver into <em>acetaldehyde</em> by <em>alcohol
dehydrogenase</em> (enzyme produced by liver to break down
alcohol).</li>
<li>Rapidly oxidised to acetate, then converted to CO<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> and H<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>O</li>
<li>A very small portion is unprocessed and excreted via kidneys, lungs
and skin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alcohol also contains large amounts of carbohydrates (depending on
the mixer), which the body either burns immediately (as with calorie
“saving”), or is stored as fat.</li>
<li>Alcohol is broken down by the body at a rate of 0.015g/hr (reducing
your BAC by .0.15g/hr), or 1 standard drink per hour.</li>
<li>Unmetabolised alcohol travels around the body via the blood stream
until it is able to be broken down by the liver.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Measures the ratio of alcohol to total blood volume in the
body.</li>
<li>Used to measure/guide physiological and behavioural effects of
alcohol.</li>
<li>Can vary between individuals based on their weight and percentage of
body fat:
<ul>
<li>Higher ratio of muscle/water = higher rate of diffusal into
tissues.</li>
<li>Lower ratio of muscle/water (i.e. higher percentage of body fat) =
lower rate of diffusal into tissues (i.e. men vs. women)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Women also have a less active composition of alcohol dehydrogenase
than men</li>
<li>On average, a woman of a similar size and weight to a man will have
a 30% higher BAC.</li>
<li>Certain points of the menstrual cycle and the use of contraceptives
further reduce the rate of alcohol metabolism.</li>
<li>BAC breath tests are more accurate than urine tests.</li>
<li>Long term use of alcohol also effected by our adaptive nervous
systems (increase in tolerance), requiring larger amounts of alcohol to
achieve the desired effect.</li>
<li><em>Learned Behavioural Tolerance</em> explains a person’s behaviour
modifications to appear sober.</li>

<ul>
<li>Light to moderate consumption of red wine has been linked to a
reduced risk in coronary artery disease (as a result of HDLs: “good
cholesterol”)</li>
<li>This beneficial effect is also related to the effects on blood
clotting, insulin sensitivity and inflammation.</li>
<li>Heavy drinking responsible for cardiomyopathy, and heart
arrhythmias.</li>
<li>Excess alcohol consumption has also been linked to higher blood
pressure, increased risk of stroke and heart attack.</li>
<li>Alcohol, tobacco and other drugs also increase the risk of damage to
the heart.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Liver Disease</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Unprocessed alcohol in the liver known as fatty liver (reducing
liver function).</li>
<li>This unprocessed alcohol in the liver can then cause
<em>fibrosis</em>, where scar tissue forms on damaged part of the
liver.</li>
<li><em>Cirrhosis</em> involves further damage to the liver, causing
liver cells to die, introducing permanent damage.</li>
<li>Chronic inflammation of the liver, or <em>Alcoholic Hepatitis</em>
may develop through prolonged use of alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cancer</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Cancer is strongly associated with alcohol use in men and
women.</li>
<li>The risks are significantly higher for women than men, through the
total amount consumed in a lifetime, rather than the regularity of
consumption.</li>
<li>Alcohol use has been linked to oesophageal, colon, rectal, breast,
stomach, oral cavity and liver cancer.</li>
<li>The most prevalent form of cancer in men is colorectal, and breast
cancer in women.</li>
<li>The risk of breast cancer is enhanced even when drinking at moderate
levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Pregnancy</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol is one of 30 known teratogens.</li>
<li>The 3rd most common cause of birth defects.</li>
<li>Children are especially susceptible to organ development risks in
the first trimester.</li>
<li>Children are especially susceptible to CNS development risks in the
third trimester.</li>
<li>FASD (Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders) is an umbrella term used to
describe a number of alcohol related developmental syndromes:
<ul>
<li>FAS: Foetal Alcohol Syndrome</li>
<li>PFAS: Partial Foetal Alcohol Syndrome</li>
<li>ARND: Alcohol Related Neuro-Developmental Disorder</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FASD is the most common preventable mental impairment in the Western
World.</li>

<li>Binge drinking is defined as 5 or more (men), or 4 or more (women)
standard drinks within a 2 hour period.</li>
<li>Can be considered binge drinking if the above amounts are consumed
as little as once a week.</li>
<li>Nearly 2% of this cohort report sex without consent.</li>
<li>Members of this age group are more likely to engage in heavier
drinking with the following negative impacts:
<ul>
<li>School sporting teams</li>
<li>In an abusive relationship</li>
<li>Higher stress levels</li>
<li>Belonged to a fraternity / sorority</li>
<li>were depressed.</li>

<ul>
<li>Refers to the act of drinking heavily at home before attending an
event or other location.</li>
<li>Increases potential for passing out, drink driving, aggression,
alcohol poisoning and violence.</li>
<li>Drinking games (beer pong, quarters, flip cup)</li>
<li>Less likely to monitor drinking, can lead to black outs, regrettable
sexual experiences, injury and death.</li>

<strong>Definition according to the DSM5</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is experienced by any person who meets 2
or more of the criteria</li>
<li>Severity can be from mild to severe based on the number of criteria
met (i.e. strong desire or craving to use alcohol, high tolerance to
alcohol).</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Identifying an Alcoholic</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>As with other addictions: craving, loss of control, tolerance,
psychological dependence, withdrawal.</li>
<li>Not restricted to specific socio-economic, cultural, professional,
geographic, ethnic, religious or racial groups.</li>
<li>The person may have an extreme difficulty in recognising and
admitting to the problem.</li>
<li>Approximately 7.5% of 18 to 24 year old Australians are thought to
be alcoholics.</li>
<li><em>Functional Alcoholics:</em> Typically educated, hold a steady
job, have a family, have reached middle age. Outwardly appear to have
their lives in order, however, it catches up with them over time.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Causes of AUD</strong>
</summary>
<p><strong>Biological / Family factors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher rates among children of alcoholic parents.</li>
<li>4 to 8 times more likely among this group than in families with no
history of alcohol abuse.</li>
<li>No specific ‘alcoholic gene’ found to date, although links have been
found with biological parents and adopted children (approx. 60%
heritable).</li>
<li>Promotes the productions of dopamine in the body, with diminished
production in alcoholics, which aids in the escalating use of alcohol to
achieve the same results.</li>
<li>Ability to develop addiction is thought to be linked across several
genes, rather than just one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social/Cultural Factors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Used to dull the pain of an acute loss or emotional social problem,
becoming worse over time through repeated exposure to alcohol.</li>
<li>People exposed to alcohol through the family meal, or religious
ceremonies are less prone to addiction.</li>
<li>More common in communities who see alcohol as a rite of passage to
adulthood.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>AUD in Women</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Women are more susceptible than men to endure damage from drinking.
<ul>
<li>More likely in older women with a lower history of drinking.</li>
<li>Greater risk of cirrhosis, heart disease, cancers than male
alcoholics.</li>
<li>Female death rates from alcoholism are 50% to 100% higher than in
men.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Alcohol and Prescription Drug Abuse</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>When taken together severe medical problems can result.
<ul>
<li>Greatest risks through combination of alcohol and pain killers.</li>
<li>Together inhibit the coughing reflex, may stop breathing
completely.</li>
<li>Falls and unintentional injuries may result from combining with
anxiety, antipsychotic, antidepressant, sleep medications and muscle
relaxants.
<ul>
<li>Opioids: Vicodin, OxyContin, Percocet</li>
<li>Stimulants: Retalin, Adderall, Concerta</li>
<li>Sedative/Anxiety: Ativan, Xanax</li>
<li>Sleep: Ambien, Halcion</li>
</ul></li>

<summary>
<strong>Costs to Society</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Approximately AUD$14.35 billion per year
<ul>
<li>Costs are borne through Health Insurance, Criminal Justice (20.6%),

accidents, violence and abuse.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Treatment and Recovery</strong>
</summary>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Refusal to admit to problem</li>
<li>Social Stigma</li>
<li>Requirements for abstinence</li>

<strong>Detoxification</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Detoxification requires the body to be purged of the substance, and
involves hyperexcitability, confusion, agitation, sleep disorders,
convulsions, tremors, depression, headache, seizures.
<ul>
<li>DT (<em>delirium tremens</em>) effects a small number of people over
and above the symptoms of detoxification, and can cause confusion,
delusions, agitation and hallucinations.</li>
<li>Various treatment options available through
psychologist/psychiatrist, private rehab centres, community mental
health centres and support groups (alcoholics Anonymous).</li>
<li>Private treatment involves physical exam to identify any underlying
medical issues that may interfere with treatment. Programs can last 3 to
6 weeks, with psychological treatment commencing after detox.</li>
<li>Therapy is available (family, group, individual) depending on
circumstances of individual or the desired outcomes.</li>
<li>Relapse is common in the first year with 30% of clients. Coping
mechanisms for triggers are the focus of treatment as well as other
techniques to assist in changing behaviours.</li>

<h5>Discuss the rate of tobacco use in Australia.</h5>
<ul>
<li>After caffeine and alcohol, nicotine is the next most commonly used
psychoactive drug in society today.</li>
<li>Despite the known health effects related to tobacco use, nicotine is
a legal drug, with sale of nicotine-based substances providing many
tobacco companies and governments (as a result of tobacco tax) with a
vast income.</li>
<li>Worldwide, smoking accounts for almost 9% of deaths (12% of male
deaths, 6% of females).</li>
<li>Usage rates have declines significantly in the UK, with
Approximately 80% of men and 40% of women smoking during the 1950s,
compared to 39% of men and 33% of women by 1998.</li>
<li>In Australia the national prevalence fell below 20% in 2002, and
fell further to 16.6% in 2010.</li>

<h5>Explain the psychological, social and political issues involved in
tobacco use and prevention.</h5>
<ul>
<li>Smoking delivers a strong dose of nicotine as well as 7000 other
chemical substances, including arsenic, form-aldehyde, and ammonia,
directly to the lungs.</li>
<li>More than 70 of these chemicals are known or suspected
carcinogens.</li>
<li>Inhaling irritating chemicals weaken the tissues and contribute to
cancers of the mouth, larynx, and throat, with the heat from tobacco
smoke is also being harmful to tissues.</li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Nicotine</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Nicotine is a highly addictive chemical stimulant, and the major
psychoactive substance in all tobacco products. It’s a colourless liquid
that turns brown on exposure to air.</li>
<li>Nicotine is either ingested via the lungs, or the mucous membranes
in the mouth (chewing tobacco).</li>
<li>Nicotine is a powerful CNS stimulant producing a variety of
physiological effects:
<ul>
<li>It produces an aroused, alert mental state in the cerebral
cortex.</li>
<li>Stimulates the adrenal glands, increasing the production of
adrenaline.</li>
<li>Increases heart and respiratory rates, constricts blood vessels,
which increases blood pressure because the heart must work harder to
pump blood through the narrowed vessels.</li>
<li><em>Nicotine Poisoning</em> can include dizziness, light-headedness,
rapid and erratic pulse, clammy skin, nausea and vomiting, and
diarrhoea.</li>
<li>These effects are present from the first ingestion, but cease with
tolerance after around the second or third cigarette.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Tar and carbon monoxide</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Particulate matter from cigarette smoke condenses in the lungs to
form a thick, brownish sludge called tar, containing various
carcinogenic agents such as benzopyrene and chemical irritants such as
phenol.</li>
<li>Phenol has the potential to combine with other chemicals that
contribute to developing lung cancer.</li>
<li>The cilia’s cleansing function is impaired in smokers’ lungs by
nicotine, which paralyses the cilia for up to 1 hour after a single
cigarette, allowing tars and other solids in tobacco smoke to accumulate
and irritate sensitive lung tissue.</li>
<li>Cigarette smoke also contains <em>carbon monoxide</em> (as in in car
exhaust), which reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells
by binding with the receptor sites for oxygen, causing oxygen
deprivation in many body tissues.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Tobacco Use Disorder</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Defined as a ’problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to
clinically significant impairment or distress, that is characterised by
at least two of the following signs and symptoms in a 12-month period:
<ul>
<li>Use of tobacco in larger amounts or over a longer period of time
than intended.</li>
<li>Persistent desire and unsuccessful efforts to cut down or quit.</li>
<li>Spending a large amount of time getting or using tobacco.</li>

<li>Persistent tobacco use in physically hazardous situations, such as
smoking in bed.</li>
<li>Continued tobacco use despite a persistent or reoccurring physical
or psychological problem resulting from tobacco use.</li>

class="section level5">
<h5>The five characteristics of a healthful diet</h5>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>1. Adequate</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>An adequate diet supplies sufficient energy, nutrients, and fibre
for maintaining health.</li>
<li>Diet adequacy can vary within different aspects, where one area
might be sufficient while another lacks.</li>
<li>Many Americans have enough protein, fat, and carbohydrates but lack
fibre and certain micronutrients due to low vegetable intake.</li>
<li>Some individuals are overweight despite inadequate vegetable intake,
as excess energy is consumed.</li>
<li>Adequacy of a diet differs from person to person; a small, lightly
active woman needs 1700 to 2000 kcal/day, while an active male athlete
requires over 4000 kcal/day.</li>
<li>Diverse nutritional needs exist based on activity levels, including
fat, carbohydrate, protein, and other nutrients.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>2. Moderate</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Food intake should be moderate, avoiding both excessive and
insufficient consumption.</li>
<li>Imbalanced food consumption can negatively impact health goals.</li>
<li>Overconsumption, like drinking excessive soft drinks (765 kcal from
three 600 ml bottles), can lead to weight gain.</li>
<li>Compensating for high-calorie intake requires reducing overall food
consumption, potentially eliminating nutritious foods.</li>
<li>Choosing water and low-calorie beverages allows for more intake of
nourishing foods.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>3. Nutrient Dense</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>A nutrient-dense diet offers maximum nutrients with minimal
Calories.</li>
<li>Figure 6.1 illustrates a comparison between high and low nutrient
density meals.</li>
<li>A turkey sandwich on whole-grain bread is nutrient-dense, providing
fibre, healthy fats, and micronutrients at a low Caloric cost.</li>
<li>In contrast, a cheeseburger is lower in nutrients, fibre, and higher
in Calories.</li>
<li>Nutrient density comparisons in the figure aid in choosing such
foods throughout the day.</li>
<li>Supermarkets use indicators like numbers or stars on labels to guide
healthier choices.</li>
<li>Higher numbers or stars signify higher nutrient density, helping
shoppers.</li>
<li>The NuVal system is the most common nutritional guidance system in
US supermarkets.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>4. Balanced</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>A balanced diet includes well-proportioned nutrient combinations
from different foods.</li>
<li>Body’s health maintenance requires various foods in diverse
quantities.</li>
<li>Fruits and vegetables offer fiber, vitamin C, potassium, and
magnesium.</li>
<li>Meats are rich in protein, iron, zinc, and copper, but lack certain
nutrients.</li>
<li>Maintaining health demands proper nutrient balance from different
food groups.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>5. Varied</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Variety entails regularly consuming diverse foods from different
food groups.</li>
<li>Exploring thousands of healthy options adds fun and ease to diet
diversification.</li>
<li>Incorporate novelty by trying a new vegetable weekly or swapping
ingredients.</li>
<li>Opting for various foods enhances intake of necessary
nutrients.</li>
<li>A diverse diet prevents monotony and guards against falling into a
‘food rut’.</li>

<h5>Identify the mechanisms that contribute to our sense of hunger.</h5>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Why do we feel the urge to eat?</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appetite vs. Hunger:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Appetite:</em> Desire to eat triggered by food’s sight, smell,
or thought.</li>
<li><em>Hunger:</em> Physiological urge for food when the body senses a
need.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Appetite and Hunger Relationship:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Appetite can exist even when not hungry, like craving dessert after
a meal.</li>
<li>Hunger corresponds to the body’s actual need for food.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Anorexia and Physiological Need:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Anorexia:</em> Lack of appetite despite the body’s requirement
for food.</li>
<li>Can be due to illnesses, mood disorders, or medication side effects

</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>The hypothalamus regulates hunger</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hunger as Physiological Stimulus:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hunger compels us to find and eat food but is often perceived as
negative.</li>
<li>The brain, not the stomach, is the primary organ responsible for
this sensation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Role of the Hypothalamus:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hypothalamus, located above the pituitary gland in the forebrain,
drives the urge to eat.</li>
<li>It houses a cluster of nerve cells, the feeding centre, triggering
hunger.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Feeding and Satiety Centres:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Feeding centre signals hunger; satiety centre signals fullness.</li>
<li>Satiety centre inhibits feeding centre, causing us to stop
eating.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Food Intake Regulation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Feeding and satiety centres coordinate food intake regulation.</li>
<li>Signals from gastrointestinal nerves, hormones, and food type/amount
are integrated.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Nerve cells in the gastrointestinal system signal the
hypothalamus</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nerve Cells and Hunger/Satiety:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nerve cells in stomach and small intestine provide important signals
for hunger and fullness.</li>
<li>They detect changes in pressure based on organ’s empty or
food-distended state.</li>
<li>Data from these cells are sent to the hypothalamus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hunger Mechanism:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If stomach and small intestine lack food due to extended fasting,
signals to hypothalamus suppress satiety centre.</li>
<li>Feeding centre dominates, leading to the sensation of hunger.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mouth, Pharynx, and Oesophagus Involvement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nerve cells in these areas contribute to feelings of hunger and
fullness.</li>
<li>Chewing and swallowing stimulate these nerve cells.</li>
<li>Data relayed to the hypothalamus’s satiety centre causes a sensation
of fullness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hormones and Functions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hormones are proteins or lipids secreted by glands into the
bloodstream.</li>
<li>Act as messengers, binding to distant target cells to trigger
responses.</li>
<li>Relative hormone levels regulate various body functions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Insulin vs. Glucagon:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Both of these hormones work in tandem to maintain blood glucose
levels, affecting hunger.</li>
<li>Low blood glucose leads to decreased insulin and increased
glucagon.</li>
<li>Hypothalamus detects these changes, prompting hunger.</li>
<li>Post-meal, stomach/intestine distention and nutrient absorption
raise glucose levels, increasing insulin and reducing glucagon, leading
to satiety.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ghrelin, CCK, and Leptin:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Ghrelin:</em> Produced by stomach, stimulates hunger.</li>
<li>After meals, ghrelin levels drop; time since last meal raises
ghrelin, promoting eating.</li>
<li>Dieting increases ghrelin levels.</li>
<li><em>Cholecystokinin (CCK):</em> Small intestine-produced
hormone.</li>
<li>Triggers signals to hypothalamus promoting satiety.</li>
<li>Regulates meal duration and size.</li>
<li><em>Leptin:</em> Produced by fat cells when excess energy is
stored.</li>
<li>Induces satiety by acting on the hypothalamus.</li>
<li>Obesity can lead to leptin resistance, impairing its effects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The amount and type of food play a role
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Satiety and Protein-rich Foods:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Protein-rich foods have the highest satiety value.</li>
<li>Ham and egg breakfast induces and maintains satiety better than
pancakes with the same Calories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fibre and Water-rich Meals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bulky meals rich in fibre and water stretch stomach/intestine,
signalling fullness to the hypothalamus, leading to cessation of
eating.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Beverages vs. Foods:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Beverages are less satisfying than semi-solid foods.</li>
<li>Semi-solid foods have lower satiety than solid foods. (i.e. Eating
grapes triggers greater fullness compared to drinking grape juice with
the same Calories).</li>

<h5>Identify strategies for making nutritious food choices.</h5>
A Mediterranean-style eating pattern is often considered healthful due
to its association with lower rates of cardiovascular disease and
potential benefits for cognitive health. Here are the key aspects and
benefits of this eating pattern:
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protein Sources</strong>: Red meat is consumed only monthly,
while eggs, poultry, fish, and sweets are eaten weekly, resulting in a
diet low in saturated fats and refined sugars.</li>
<li><strong>Fats</strong>: The primary cooking and flavouring fat is
olive oil, which is high in monounsaturated fats.</li>
<li><strong>Daily Foods</strong>: The diet includes daily consumption of
grains (bread, pasta, couscous, bulgur), fruits, beans, legumes, nuts,
vegetables, cheese, and yogurt. These choices provide vitamins,
minerals, fibre, phytochemicals, probiotics, and prebiotics.</li>
<li><strong>Moderation</strong>: Wine is included in moderation.</li>
<li><strong>Health Benefits of Mediterranean-Style Eating
Pattern</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Cardiovascular Health</strong>: Studies show that this
eating pattern can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease even
without calorie restriction.</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Health</strong>: Some evidence suggests it may
reduce the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Other healthful eating patterns</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Exchange System</strong> is a tool used to follow a
healthful eating pattern, initially designed for people with diabetes.
Foods are categorised into lists based on carbohydrate, protein, fat,
and calorie content. This system helps individuals plan their meals and
manage their nutrient intake.</li>
<li><strong>Healthy Eating Plate</strong> (Harvard School of Public
Health) and <strong>Power Plate</strong> (Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine) are alternative eating patterns:
<ul>
<li><strong>Healthy Eating Plate</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Recommends plant oils, whole grains, more vegetables, lean protein
sources, and water, tea, or coffee with little added sugar.</li>
<li>Emphasises daily physical activity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Power Plate</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Emphasises fruits, legumes, vegetables, and whole grains as the
primary food groups.</li>
<li>Allows nuts and seeds.</li>
<li>Low in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium; high in fiber.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Physical Activity</strong> is crucial for overall health and
well-being.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Adults should engage in at least
150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity, and
perform muscle-strengthening exercises on 2 or more days per week.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Physical Activity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Helps maintain a healthy body weight.</li>
<li>Reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes,
cancers, and osteoporosis.</li>
<li>Supports digestion, improves sleep, enhances mood, and promotes
longevity.</li>

and globally and the health risks associated with excess weight.</h5>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>The terms “overweight” and “obesity”</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The terms <strong>overweight</strong> and <strong>obesity</strong>
are used to categorize individuals based on their body weight and body
mass index (BMI), which is a measure of body weight relative to
height.</li>
<li>Overweight refers to a condition in which a person’s body weight is
more than 10 percent above the recommended levels for health. It is
often characterised by a BMI between 25 and 29.</li>
<li>Being overweight carries health risks, including an increased
likelihood of developing certain medical conditions, such as heart
disease and type 2 diabetes.</li>
<li>Obesity is a more severe condition characterised by a body weight
that is more than 20 percent above the recommended levels for health or
a BMI over 30.</li>
<li>Obesity is associated with a higher risk of various health problems,
including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, certain cancers, and
musculoskeletal disorders.</li>
</ul>
Obesity can be further classified into different classes based on BMI: -
Class 1 Obesity: Individuals with a BMI greater than 30 but less than
35. - Class 2 Obesity: Individuals with a BMI greater than 35 but less
than 40. - Class 3 Obesity: This category includes individuals with a
BMI greater than 40, often referred to as “morbidly obese.” Class 3
obesity is associated with the highest health risks among the obesity
classes.
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Overweight and Obesity in Australia</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The rates of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents
remained relatively stable from 2007-2008 to 2014-2015.</li>
<li>During this period, approximately 26 percent of Australian children
aged 2-17 years were classified as overweight or obese.</li>
<li>It’s important to note that socio-economic factors play a
significant role in obesity risk, with children from low-income,
low-education, and higher-unemployment households being at greater
risk.</li>
<li>Addressing the issue of overweight and obesity requires a
comprehensive approach that includes understanding the factors
influencing food choices, food intake, and overeating behaviour.</li>
<li>Interventions should be tailored to specific population groups and
consider the effectiveness of health promotion campaigns, especially
among children who may have varying levels of understanding of health
messages.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Obesity Worldwide</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Global obesity rates have more than doubled since 1980.</li>
<li>Over 1.9 billion adults worldwide are classified as overweight, and
600 million are obese.</li>
<li>Obesity was once primarily seen in high-income countries but is now
a problem in low- and middle-income nations as well.</li>
<li>This global issue is commonly referred to as “globesity.”</li>
<li>Factors contributing to the rise in obesity include sedentary jobs,
widespread marketing of high-fat and high-carb foods, and increased
global food distribution.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Health risks of excess weight</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>While smoking as the leading cause of preventable death in the US,
obesity is gaining ground.</li>
<li>Obesity is linked to various health problems, including
cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, hypertension, diabetes,
depression, digestive issues, gallstones, sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis,
decreased mobility, and loss of independence.</li>
<li>Obese individuals face specific risks compared to non-obese
individuals, such as a 104 percent increase in the risk of heart
failure.</li>
<li>BMI greater than 30 reduces life expectancy by 2 to 4 years, while
BMI greater than 40 can cost 8 to 10 years of life expectancy, similar
to the impact of long-term smoking.</li>
<li>Obesity often persists from childhood into adolescence and
adulthood, with a high percentage of obese children becoming obese
adults.</li>
<li>Diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, is strongly associated with
overweight and obesity and is a significant concern.</li>
<li>Other health risks related to obesity include pregnancy
complications, inflammation, asthma, elevated blood lipids,
musculoskeletal problems, increased fall and disability risks, fatty
liver and gall bladder issues, polycystic ovary syndrome, depression,
reproductive health problems, sexual dysfunction, and social
consequences like isolation, bullying, stigmatisation, discrimination,
and reduced quality of life.</li>

<p><strong><em>Factors Putting People At Risk of
Obesity</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Genetic and Hormonal Factors</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Genetics plays a role in appetite regulation, with some individuals
inheriting a lower sensitivity to feeling full, potentially leading to
overeating.</li>
<li>The FTO gene is highlighted as having importance in regulating
ghrelin, a hormone that affects appetite and metabolism, and leptin,
which signals fullness.</li>
<li>Leptin, produced by fat cells, increases as fat tissue increases,
signalling fullness and reducing appetite.</li>
<li>Obese individuals may have excess ghrelin production and faulty
leptin receptors.</li>
<li>Genetic variations may influence eating patterns, calorie
consumption, and food preferences, particularly during adolescence.</li>
<li>Clusters of genes may impact food intake regulation, affecting the
central nervous system and fat cell function.</li>
<li>While genetics can play a role in obesity tendencies, a healthy
lifestyle and physical activity can help counteract genetic
influences.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Individual Biology and Weight Loss</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Some individuals may have a “thrifty metabolism” that slows down
significantly in response to calorie restriction, making weight loss
challenging.</li>
<li>Others with a “spendthrift metabolism” maintain metabolic rate even
with reduced calorie intake, resulting in more successful weight
loss.</li>
<li>It’s uncertain whether these metabolic responses have a genetic
basis or develop over time.</li>
<li>Fasting and extreme low-calorie diets can slow metabolism, hindering
weight loss.</li>
<li>Adaptive thermogenesis is a mechanism where the body slows metabolic
activity in response to weight loss, leading to increased hunger and
weight regain.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Metabolic Rates</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum energy expenditure
required for basic bodily functions. It typically ranges from 1200 to
1800 calories per day in healthy adults.</li>
<li>Resting metabolic rate (RMR) includes BMR plus energy expended
during daily sedentary activities.</li>
<li>Exercise metabolic rate (EMR) accounts for calories burned during
physical activity.</li>
<li>BMR and RMR decrease with age, contributing to weight gain in
middle-aged individuals.</li>
<li>Adaptive thermogenesis can further slow metabolism during weight
loss, making it challenging to maintain weight loss.</li>
<li>Yo-yo dieting, where individuals repeatedly lose and regain weight,
can result in lower BMR after each cycle.</li>
<li>Set point theory suggests the body maintains a narrow weight range,
making long-term weight loss difficult but not impossible.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Fat Cells and Predisposition to Fatness</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Some obese individuals may have an excessive number of fat cells,
known as hyperplastic obesity.</li>
<li>Hyperplastic obesity often develops in early childhood, influenced
possibly by maternal dietary habits and critical developmental
periods.</li>
<li>While the number of fat cells does not significantly increase in
adulthood, their ability to swell or shrink persists.</li>
<li>Weight gain can be linked to both the number of fat cells and the
size of individual cells.</li>

<li>The environment today offers a multitude of high-calorie,
low-nutrient foods.</li>
<li>Constant advertising bombards individuals with messages promoting
consumption, often prioritising flavour over nutrition.</li>
<li>Super-sized portions have become the norm, leading to increased
calorie and fat intake.</li>
<li>High-calorie coffee and sugary drinks are readily available,
enticing people to consume additional calories between meals.</li>
<li>Misleading food labels can confuse consumers regarding appropriate
serving sizes.</li>
</ul>

<summary>
<strong>Changes in Food Consumption</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>While Americans have increased their daily calorie consumption by
about 500 calories since 1970, there have been shifts in the types of
foods consumed.</li>
<li>Access to commercially grown vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, eggs,
nuts, sugar, sweeteners, fats, and oils has all changed.</li>
<li>Despite increased access to healthier foods, obesity rates have not
seen significant declines.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Lack of Physical Activity</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>In addition to genetics, metabolism, and environment, lifestyle
choices play a significant role in weight management.</li>
<li>Sedentary lifestyles have become increasingly common.</li>
<li>Many individuals are eating more while simultaneously engaging in
less physical activity.</li>
<li>In Australia, a substantial portion of adults did not meet
recommended guidelines for physical activity, with less than 150 minutes
of physical activity in the previous week.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong><em>Other Factors</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Psychosocial Factors</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Eating often serves as a social ritual associated with
companionship, celebration, and enjoyment.</li>
<li>Comfort food is used to cope with emotional insecurities and life
challenges.</li>
<li>Friends and loved ones can significantly influence eating
behaviours.</li>
<li>Research suggests that overweight and obese individuals tend to
associate with others who have similar weight statuses.</li>
<li>Social support for weight loss and social undermining of weight loss
efforts both play roles in gaining or losing weight.</li>
<li>External factors, including social influences, may have an equal or
greater impact on the obesity epidemic than individual factors.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Socio-economic Factors</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>People in poverty may have limited access to fresh, nutrient-dense
foods, opting for less expensive, high-calorie processed foods.</li>
<li>Individuals with demanding work schedules and long commutes may
struggle to find time for cooking nutritious meals.</li>
<li>Barriers like expensive gym memberships or inconveniently located
fitness facilities can limit physical activity.</li>
<li>Environmental factors, such as a lack of well-lit foot paths and
safe places to exercise, can also hinder physical activity.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Emerging Theories on Obesity Risks</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Some studies investigate the <strong>role of pathogens</strong>,
including viruses and bacteria, in altering intestinal flora,
metabolism, and insulin sensitivity.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical exposure</strong>, such as from paints, pesticides,
and other products, is being examined for its potential link to
obesity.</li>
<li>The influence of certain prescription <strong>drugs</strong> on
weight gain and fluctuations is also under scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep deprivation</strong> may lead to drops in leptin
levels, disrupting circadian rhythms and increasing the risk of
obesity.</li>

<h5>Discuss reliable options for determining a healthy weight and body
fat percentage.</h5>
<p><strong><em>Body Mass Index (BMI)</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>BMI Calculation</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>BMI is a measure of body weight relative to height.</li>
<li>where <span class="math inline">\(kg\)</span> = weight and <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> = height:</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(BMI = \frac{kg}{m^2}\)</span></li>
<li>There are online calculators available to determine BMI, such as the
one provided by the <a
href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm">National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</a>.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>BMI Categories</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Healthy weight is typically defined as having a BMI between 18.5 and
24.9, which is considered the range with the lowest statistical health
risk.</li>
<li>A BMI of 25 to 29.9 indicates overweight and potentially significant
health risks.</li>
<li>A BMI of 30 to 39.9 is classified as obese.</li>
<li>A BMI of 40 to 49.9 is categorised as morbidly obese.</li>
<li>A new category of BMI of 50 or higher, known as “super obese,” has
been identified and is increasing in numbers.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Limitations of BMI</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>BMI has some limitations, as it does not account for factors such as
water, muscle mass, and bone mass.</li>
<li>It doesn’t consider that muscle weighs more than fat.</li>
<li>BMI levels may not be accurate for individuals who are very short,
highly muscled, or older with little muscle mass.</li>
<li>Despite its limitations, BMI remains a quick, inexpensive, and
useful tool for developing basic health recommendations.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Youth and BMI</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Obesity among youth is a concern, with approximately 7 percent of
youth in Australia being obese.</li>
<li>There is growing concern about the use of labels like “obese” and
“morbidly obese” for youth, as they may increase bias and stigma.</li>
<li>BMI ranges for children and teens are labeled differently, such as
“at risk of overweight” and “overweight,” to avoid causing shame.</li>
<li>Specific guidelines for calculating BMI in youth take into account
normal differences in body fat between boys and girls and the variations
in body fat at different ages.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong><em>Waist Circumference and Ratio
Measurements</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Fat Distribution Differences</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Men and post-menopausal women tend to store fat in the upper regions
of the body, particularly the abdominal area.</li>
<li>Pre-menopausal women typically store fat in the lower regions of
their bodies, such as the hips, buttocks, and thighs.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Measurement of Abdominal Fat</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Various measurements are used to assess abdominal fat as an
indicator of obesity and health risk.</li>
<li>Waist circumference, waist circumference-to-hip ratio, and waist
circumference-to-height ratio are commonly used metrics.</li>
<li>A waistline greater than 40 inches (102 cm) in men and greater than
35 inches (88 cm) in women may indicate a higher health risk.</li>
<li>For individuals who are very short (less than 5 feet tall) or have a
high BMI (35 or above), standard waist circumference measurements for
the general population might not be applicable.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Waist-to-Hip Ratio</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The waist-to-hip ratio is a measure of regional fat
distribution.</li>
<li>A higher waist-to-hip ratio is associated with an increased
likelihood of health risks.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Waist Circumference-to-Height Ratio:</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>This ratio is a simple screening tool that suggests that a person’s
waist circumference should be approximately half of their height.</li>
<li>For example, if a person is 180 cm tall, their waist shouldn’t be
more than 90 cm.</li>
<li>Newer research suggests that waist-to-hip ratio may be more
effective than waist circumference alone or BMI in measuring body fat in
children and adolescents.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong><em>Measures of Body Fat</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Underwater (Hydrostatic) Weighing</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Measures the amount of water a person displaces when completely
submerged.</li>
<li>Fat tissue is less dense than muscle or bone, so body fat can be
computed within a 2%–3% margin of error by comparing weight underwater
and out of water.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Skinfolds</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Involves “pinching” a person’s fold of skin (with its underlying
layer of fat) at various locations of the body.</li>
<li>The fold is measured using a specially designed caliper.</li>
<li>When performed by a skilled technician, it can estimate body fat
with an error of 3%–4%.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Involves sending a very low level of electrical current through a
person’s body.</li>
<li>As lean body mass is made up of mostly water, the rate at which the
electricity is conducted gives an indication of a person’s lean body
mass and body fat.</li>
<li>Under the best circumstances, BIA can estimate body fat with an
error of 3%–4%.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The technology is based on using very-low-level X ray to
differentiate between bone tissue, soft (or lean) tissue, and fat (or
adipose) tissue.</li>
<li>The margin of error for predicting body fat is 2%–4%.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Bod Pod</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Uses air displacement to measure body composition in a large,
egg-shaped chamber made from fibreglass.</li>
<li>The person being measured sits in the machine wearing a swimsuit.
the door is closed and the machine measures how much air is
displaced.</li>
<li>That value is used to calculate body fat, with a 2%–3% margin of
error.</li>

<h5>Explain the effectiveness and potential pros and cons of various
weight control strategies, including exercise, diet, lifestyle
modification, supplements and diet drugs, surgery, and other
options.</h5>
<p><strong><em>Understanding Calories and Energy
Balance</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition of a Calorie:</strong> A calorie is a unit of
measurement that represents the amount of energy obtained from food or
expended through physical activity.</li>
<li><strong>Calories and Weight Gain/Loss:</strong> The passage
discusses how the balance of calories consumed and calories expended is
related to weight gain or loss. Specifically, it mentions the following:
<ul>
<li>To gain one pound (about half a kilogram) of storage fat, an
individual needs to consume approximately 3500 calories more than their
body requires to maintain its current weight.</li>
<li>Conversely, to lose one pound of fat, a person needs to expend an
extra 3500 calories through physical activity or reduce their calorie
intake.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Caloric Surplus and Deficit Example:</strong> The passage
provides practical examples to illustrate the concept of calorie
balance:
<ul>
<li>If a person consumes 140 calories more than their body needs every
day without making any other dietary or activity changes, they would
gain half a kilogram in 25 days.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if a person engages in a daily 30-minute walk,
burning 172 calories (in addition to their regular activities), they
would lose half a kilogram in approximately 20.3 days.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong><em>Diet and Eating Behaviours</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Mindless Eating</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Many people engage in mindless eating, where they eat quickly,
without awareness, and often in front of the TV or computer.</li>
<li>This behaviour can lead to overeating and excess calorie
consumption, contributing to weight gain.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Eating Mindfully</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Eating mindfully means being aware of:
<ul>
<li>why you’re eating (are you truly hungry or is it a trigger?),</li>
<li>what you’re eating (is it a healthy choice?), and</li>
<li>how much you’re eating (portion control).</li>
<li>It encourages savouring the flavours and textures of food.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Identifying Eating Triggers</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>To change unhealthy eating habits, it’s crucial to identify what
triggers you to eat.</li>
<li>Keeping a log of when, what, where, and how much you eat for a few
days can help pinpoint these triggers.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Common Dietary Triggers</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Dietary triggers are often related to emotions and situations rather
than genuine hunger.</li>
<li>Stress, boredom, and mind wandering can lead to compulsive
eating.</li>
<li>Recognising whether you’re truly hungry or eating for comfort and
distraction is essential.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Tips for Improved Eating</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The passage offers practical tips for improving eating habits, such
as limiting food intake while working or watching TV, and eating slowly
to savour the food.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Choosing a Diet Plan</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Once you’ve identified your triggers, the next step is to create a
plan for better eating.</li>
<li>The passage advises seeking assistance from reputable sources, such
as registered dietitians, physicians, or health educators.</li>
<li>It also warns against weight-loss programs that promise quick or
unrealistic results and suggests assessing the nutrient value and
suitability of any prescribed diet.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Successful Diet Plans</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Effective diet plans should allow you to make food choices in
real-life situations and not require radical behaviour changes or
extreme restrictions.</li>
<li>They should align with your tastes, budget, and lifestyle.</li>
<li>The passage suggests checking the Academy of Nutrition and
Dietetics’ website for reviews of various diet plans.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong><em>Weight Control Strategies</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Exercise and Weight Loss</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Exercise, when combined with a healthy diet, can aid in weight loss
by increasing muscle mass and metabolism.</li>
<li>Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue, so having more
muscle can help you burn more calories even at rest.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Factors Affecting Calorie Expenditure</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The number of calories burned through physical activity depends on
the muscles used, the amount of weight moved, and the duration of the
activity.</li>
<li>Activities that involve both the arms and legs tend to burn more
calories.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Gradual Weight Loss</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Rapid, drastic weight loss is neither realistic nor
sustainable.</li>
<li>It’s recommended to aim for a gradual weight loss of about 0.5 to 1
kilogram per week, achieved through a combination of exercise and
calorie reduction.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Very-Low-Calorie Diets (VLCDs)</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>In severe cases of obesity, medically supervised VLCDs with daily
calorie values of 400 to 700 calories may be used.</li>
<li>These diets should only be undertaken with strict medical
supervision due to potential health risks.</li>
<li>VLCDs can lead to various complications, including blood sugar
imbalances and ketoacidosis.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Weight-Loss Supplements and Over-the-Counter Drugs</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>There are many over-the-counter supplements and drugs claiming to
promote weight loss.</li>
<li>However, most lack FDA approval, and their effectiveness is largely
unproven.</li>
<li>They often contain stimulants or diuretics and can be ineffective or
result in temporary weight loss followed by regain.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Prescription Weight-Loss Drugs</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Prescription weight-loss drugs work in various ways, such as
suppressing appetite or reducing the absorption of dietary fats.</li>
<li>However, they come with side effects, warnings, and restrictions,
and their effectiveness may vary among individuals.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Newer Weight-Loss Drugs</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>There are newer prescription weight-loss drugs on the market, such
as Belviq, Qsymia, and Contrave.</li>
<li>These drugs may combine various mechanisms to aid weight loss, but
they also have potential side effects and restrictions.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong><em>Types of Weight-Loss Surgeries</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Gastric Banding:</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>In this procedure, an inflatable band is placed around a portion of
the stomach to create a smaller upper stomach pouch.</li>
<li>This restricts food intake and prolongs the feeling of
fullness.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Sleeve Gastrectomy</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>About 75% of the stomach is removed, leaving a sleeve-shaped
portion.</li>
<li>This procedure is often used in severely obese or ill patients who
need an interim step before more invasive surgery.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Gastric Bypass</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Gastric bypass combines both restrictive and malabsorption
elements.</li>
<li>A portion of the stomach is sealed off, and the remaining pouch is
connected directly to the small intestine.</li>
<li>This leads to significant weight loss and improvement in
obesity-related health issues.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Biliopancreatic Diversion or Duodenal Switch</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>This procedure combines elements of both restrictive and
malabsorption surgeries.</li>
<li>It involves reducing the stomach size while bypassing less of the
small intestine.</li>
<li>It has a higher risk profile compared to other options.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Weight-Loss Surgery Categories</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Weight-loss surgeries can be broadly categorised into two types:
<ul>
<li><strong>Restrictive surgeries:</strong> which limit food intake,
and</li>
<li><strong>Malabsorption surgeries:</strong>, which decrease the
absorption of food into the body.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Liposuction</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Unlike other weight-loss surgeries, liposuction is a cosmetic
procedure that involves the removal of fat cells from specific areas of
the body.</li>
<li>It is not considered a true weight-loss surgery and carries its own
set of risks.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong><em>In Consideration of Surgery</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Criteria for Surgery:</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The decision to undergo weight-loss surgery is based on factors such
as a patient’s BMI, eating behaviours, obesity-related health
conditions, age, mental history, dietary history, and previous
surgeries.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Risks and Benefits</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Like weight-loss drugs, surgical interventions for obesity have
risks and benefits.</li>
<li>Patients and physicians must carefully consider these factors before
proceeding with surgery.</li>
<li>Some potential risks include nutritional deficiencies, blood clots,
leaks in surgical sites, infections, and other complications.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Benefits Beyond Weight Loss</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Gastric surgeries have shown to have unexpected benefits, including
the remission of type 2 diabetes even before significant weight
loss.</li>
<li>However, some patients may experience relapse of diabetic symptoms
within a few years after surgery.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>New Non-surgical Alternatives</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Bariatric arterial embolisation is a non-surgical option that
targets blood vessels producing the “hunger hormone” ghrelin.</li>
<li>Early trials have shown promising results in reducing hunger, but
further research is needed.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong><em>Trying to Gain Weight</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Identifying the Reason for Difficulty Gaining Weight</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The first step in addressing weight gain challenges is to identify
the underlying reasons.</li>
<li>Several factors can contribute to difficulty gaining weight,
including high physical activity levels, stress, decreased appetite due
to aging, sensory issues, visual impairments, disabilities affecting
meal preparation, and dental problems.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Athletes and Caloric Needs</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Athletes, in particular, may struggle with gaining weight because
they burn a significant number of calories during training and
competition.</li>
<li>It’s essential for them to balance their calorie expenditure with
their calorie intake to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Nutritional Deficiencies</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Extreme physical activity and exercise routines can lead to caloric
and nutritional deficiencies.</li>
<li>These deficiencies can result in weight loss, weaken the immune
system, affect organ function, increase the risk of falls and fractures,
delay recovery from diseases, and cause other health problems.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Importance of a Healthy Weight</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for overall
health and well-being.</li>
<li>Underweight individuals should evaluate their dietary and exercise
habits and take steps to address any imbalances to promote a healthy
weight.</li>

<h5>Explain trends in diabetes, describe the effect of diabetes on the
body, and differentiate among types of diabetes and their risk
factors.</h5>
<p><strong><em>Trends in Diabetes</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Definition of Diabetes</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diabetes mellitus</strong> is a group of diseases
characterised by persistently high levels of glucose (sugar) in the
blood.</li>
<li>The term “diabetes” originates from a Greek word meaning “to flow
through,” reflecting the excess glucose excreted in the urine.</li>
<li>“Mellitus” is Latin for “sweet,” referring to the sweet taste of
glucose.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Glucose in the Body</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>In a healthy individual, carbohydrates from the diet are broken down
into glucose, which serves as a primary energy source for the body.</li>
<li>Glucose is released into the bloodstream for use by various cells,
including red blood cells and nerve cells.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Role of Insulin</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>To enter cells and be used for energy, glucose requires the
assistance of insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas.</li>
<li>When there is an increase in blood glucose levels after eating, the
pancreas secretes insulin.</li>
<li>Insulin signals cells to uptake glucose from the bloodstream and use
it for immediate energy.</li>
<li>It also promotes the conversion of excess glucose into glycogen,
which is stored in the liver and muscles for future energy needs.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Glucose Regulation</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The pancreas continuously monitors blood glucose levels.</li>
<li>When glucose levels drop, insulin secretion decreases.</li>
<li>Conversely, when glucose levels rise, the pancreas secretes more
insulin to facilitate glucose uptake by cells.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong><em>Types of Diabetes and Their Risk
Factors</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Type 1 diabetes is a less prevalent but more severe form of
diabetes.</li>
<li>It is classified as an autoimmune disease in which the individual’s
immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing
cells in the pancreas.</li>
<li>This destruction of insulin-producing cells leads to a significant
reduction or cessation of insulin production.</li>
<li>Without insulin, cells cannot effectively take up glucose, resulting
in permanently elevated blood glucose levels.</li>
<li>People with Type 1 diabetes require daily insulin injections or
infusions, as well as careful monitoring of their diet and
exercise.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Type 2 diabetes accounts for the majority of diabetes cases,
approximately 90 to 95 percent.</li>
<li>It is characterised by either insufficient insulin production by the
pancreas or resistance of body cells to insulin’s effects, known as
insulin resistance.</li>
<li>The development of Type 2 diabetes is typically gradual.</li>
<li>In the early stages, body cells become resistant to insulin, and
over time, the pancreas may not produce enough insulin.</li>
<li>Factors such as excess free fatty acids, obesity, and genetic
predisposition can contribute to insulin resistance and impaired glucose
regulation.</li>
<li>As insulin resistance and dysfunction of insulin-producing cells
progress, blood glucose levels gradually rise, leading to a diagnosis of
Type 2 diabetes.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Non-Modifiable Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Type 2 diabetes is associated with non-modifiable risk factors,
including age, ethnicity, family history, and genetic and biological
factors.</li>
<li>The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes increases with age, with a
significant percentage of adults over 65 having some form of
diabetes.</li>
<li>While it was previously referred to as adult-onset diabetes, Type 2
diabetes is now increasingly diagnosed among children and teenagers,
primarily due to rising rates of obesity.</li>
<li>Genetic susceptibility plays a role in Type 2 diabetes risk, and
having a close relative with the condition is a significant risk
factor.</li>
<li>Various genes have been identified as potential contributors to
increased risk, although the precise mechanisms of inherited diabetes
are not fully understood.</li>
<li>Environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and societal policies can
also impact the development and prevalence of Type 2 diabetes.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Prediabetes</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Prediabetes is a condition characterized by higher than normal blood
glucose levels, which are not yet high enough to be classified as
full-fledged diabetes (type 2 diabetes).</li>
<li>Prediabetes is strongly linked to lifestyle factors, particularly
overweight and obesity.</li>
<li>Individuals with prediabetes may also exhibit metabolic syndrome,
which is a cluster of risk factors that increase the likelihood of
developing various health problems.</li>
<li><strong>Metabolic syndrome</strong> is associated with a fivefold
higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to individuals
without these risk factors.</li>
<li>Certain demographic groups, such as Mexican Americans, white
Americans, African Americans, and women with uterine fibroids or ovarian
cysts, are at increased risk of metabolic syndrome.</li>
<li>Without weight loss and an increase in moderate physical activity,
15 to 30 percent of individuals with prediabetes are at risk of
developing type 2 diabetes within five years.</li>
<li>More than 90% of people with prediabetes are unaware of their
condition, and less than 14 percent of the overall healthy population
understands what prediabetes is.</li>
<li>A prediabetes diagnosis represents an opportunity for individuals to
make positive lifestyle changes.</li>
<li>Increasing physical activity, in particular, can help reduce the
risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), and other
complications associated with diabetes.</li>
</ul>

<summary>
<strong>Gestational Diabetes</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Gestational diabetes is a temporary state of elevated blood glucose
levels that occurs during pregnancy, believed to be linked to metabolic
stresses that result from hormonal changes during pregnancy.</li>
<li>Approximately 18 percent of pregnancies are affected by gestational
diabetes.</li>
<li>Women who develop gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of
developing type 2 diabetes within a decade after the initial diagnosis
if they do not make lifestyle changes.</li>
<li>Maintaining excess weight after pregnancy can further elevate the
risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes with subsequent pregnancies.</li>
<li>Women with gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing
high blood pressure, high blood acidity, increased susceptibility to
infections, and a higher risk of mortality.</li>
<li>Excess fat accumulation in pregnant women can lead to the birth of
large babies, increasing the likelihood of birth injuries and the need
for caesarean sections.</li>
<li>High blood glucose levels and excess weight in pregnant women can
result in high insulin levels and blood glucose fluctuations in
newborns.</li>
<li>Babies born to women with gestational diabetes are at risk for
various health issues, including heart malformations, nervous system
abnormalities, bone deformities, respiratory distress, and fetal
death.</li>

<strong>Lifestyle Changes for Diabetes Prevention</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Studies have shown that lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of
developing type 2 diabetes by up to 58 percent.</li>
<li>For individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle changes can
sometimes delay or reduce the need for medication or insulin
injections.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Losing Weight</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study demonstrated that
regular exercise and losing as little as 5 to 7% of body weight can
significantly reduce the risk of people with prediabetes progressing to
type 2 diabetes.</li>
<li>Weight loss and exercise can lead to improvements in blood glucose
levels and overall health.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Adopting a Healthy Diet</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>People with diabetes need to pay attention to the glycemic index and
glycemic load of the foods they consume to manage blood sugar
levels.</li>
<li>The glycemic index measures the potential of foods to raise blood
glucose, while the glycemic load considers both the quality and quantity
of carbohydrates in a meal.</li>
<li>Combining high and low glycemic index foods can help control average
blood glucose levels.</li>
<li>Certain foods, such as low-fat dairy, nuts, whole grains, high fibre
foods like berries and vegetables, and fatty fish rich in omega-3 fatty
acids, may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Increasing Physical Fitness</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The American Diabetes Association recommends at least 3 minutes of
light activity every 30 minutes during long periods of sitting.</li>
<li>This change in exercise recommendations emphasizes the importance of
regular physical activity throughout the day for glucose control.</li>
<li>Exercise increases insulin sensitivity, and having more muscle mass
and using muscles regularly can lead to more efficient glucose
utilization by cells, reducing blood glucose levels.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong><em>Medical Intervention</em></strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Oral Medications</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>When lifestyle changes are not sufficient to control T2D, healthcare
providers may prescribe oral medications.</li>
<li>These medications work in different ways, such as reducing liver
glucose production, slowing carbohydrate absorption, increasing insulin
production, or improving insulin sensitivity.</li>
<li>Some medications, like SGLT2 inhibitors, promote glucose excretion
through the kidneys.</li>
<li>Medications cannot be used as a substitute for lifestyle changes, as
over time, medications may become less effective.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Metformin for Prediabetes</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>While there are potential benefits, metformin also carries risks,
especially for individuals with a history of gastrointestinal,
cardiovascular, or kidney problems.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Weight Loss Surgery</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Gastric or bariatric surgery has been shown to lead to significant
reductions in blood glucose levels and diabetes symptoms in individuals
with T2D.</li>
<li>Some patients can reduce or eliminate the need for diabetes
medications after surgery.</li>
<li>There is a growing consensus on the potential short and long-term
benefits of these surgical interventions.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Insulin Injections</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and some individuals with T2D who
cannot control their blood glucose with other treatments require insulin
injections.</li>
<li>Insulin cannot be taken orally because it would be digested in the
gastrointestinal tract.</li>
<li>Insulin is injected into the fat layer under the skin and absorbed
into the bloodstream.</li>
<li>Some T1D patients use insulin infusion pumps for continuous insulin
delivery throughout the day.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Artificial Pancreas</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Researchers are working on developing an artificial pancreas that
can mimic the function of a healthy pancreas.</li>
<li>The artificial pancreas would detect changes in blood glucose levels
and automatically release the appropriate amount of insulin.</li>
<li>While prototype devices have received approval, they may not be
widely available until the future.</li>
</ul>

<summary>
<strong>New Research on a Potential Cure for T2D</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>A new drug, when administered to mice with insulin resistance,
showed promising results in cancelling out insulin resistance and
maintaining normal blood glucose levels.</li>

Physical Activity</h3>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Definition of Physical Activity</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Physical activity refers to all body movements produced by skeletal
muscles that result in a significant increase in energy
expenditure.</li>
<li>Physical activities can vary in intensity, with examples including
light activities (e.g., casual walking), moderate activities (e.g.,
brisk walking), and vigorous activities (e.g., jogging or running).</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Categories of Physical Activity</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Physical activity can be categorized into three main types based on
their purpose: leisure-time physical activity, occupational physical
activity, and lifestyle physical activity.</li>
<li>Exercise is a subset of physical activity and is defined as planned,
repetitive, and structured bodily movement undertaken to maintain or
improve health or specific physical fitness components.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Benefits of Physical Activity</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Adding more physical activity to one’s daily routine can have
significant health benefits.</li>
<li>Physical activity is known to promote health and reduce the risk of
various negative health outcomes.</li>
<li>Physical inactivity, which is defined as not meeting minimum
activity recommendations for health, is associated with an increased
risk of conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of
cancer.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Sedentary Time</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Sedentary time refers to the time spent sitting or reclining during
activities that do not substantially increase energy expenditure (less
than 1.5 times the resting metabolic rate).</li>
<li>Common sedentary activities include screen time, reading, and
driving.</li>
<li>It’s important to note that sedentary time is distinct from physical
inactivity.</li>
<li>Some individuals who engage in regular exercise may still have high
levels of sedentary behaviour.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Impact of Sedentary Time</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Research indicates that sedentary time has an independent effect on
disease risk and mortality.</li>
<li>High amounts of sitting time are associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and type 2 diabetes.</li>
<li>Regular participation in physical activity offers various
physiological, metabolic, and psychological health-related
benefits.</li>

<strong>Reduced Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases</strong>
</summary>
<p><strong>Benefits of Aerobic Activity</strong>: - Aerobic activity is
beneficial for the cardiovascular system, which includes the heart,
lungs, and blood vessels. - Engaging in regular aerobic activity can
reduce the risk of heart-related diseases and premature death.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions Prevented or Improved by Physical
Activity</strong>: - Regular aerobic activity can prevent or improve
various cardiovascular conditions, including: - High blood pressure
(hypertension): Aerobic activity can help reduce chronic high blood
pressure, which is a significant risk factor for other cardiovascular
diseases and stroke.</p>
<strong>Improvements in Blood Lipid Profile</strong>: - Regular aerobic
activity has a positive impact on the blood lipid profile. - It
typically increases high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), often referred to
as “good” cholesterol. HDLs play a role in removing plaque build up in
the arteries, reducing the risk of coronary artery disease. - Aerobic
activity can lead to a decrease in triglycerides, which are a type of
blood fat. - It also tends to improve levels of low-density lipoproteins
(LDLs), often referred to as “bad” cholesterol, as well as total
cholesterol.
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Reduced Risk of Metabolic Syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Components of Metabolic Syndrome</strong>: Metabolic
syndrome comprises several risk factors, including:
<ul>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Abdominal obesity</li>
<li>Low levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs or “good”
cholesterol)</li>
<li>High levels of triglycerides (a type of blood fat)</li>
<li>Impaired glucose tolerance</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Regular Physical Activity for Metabolic
Syndrome</strong>: - Regular participation in moderate-intensity
physical activities can help reduce the risk of each of these risk
factors individually and when combined as part of metabolic
syndrome.</li>
<li><strong>Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes</strong>: Healthy dietary
intake combined with sufficient physical activity can potentially
prevent many cases of type 2 diabetes. This highlights the importance of
lifestyle choices, including both diet and exercise, in diabetes
prevention.</li>
<li><strong>Management of Diabetes</strong>: Meeting the recommended
guideline of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity aerobic
activity per week can improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity,
making it an effective strategy for managing diabetes.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Improved bone mass and reduced risk of osteoporosis</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Osteoporosis</strong>: Osteoporosis is a disease
characterised by low bone mass and the deterioration of bone tissue,
which increases the risk of fractures in affected individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation for Bone Health</strong>: Regular
weight-bearing and strength-building physical activities are recommended
to maintain bone health and reduce the risk of osteoporotic
fractures.</li>
<li><strong>Factors for Achieving Bone-Related Benefits of Physical
Activity</strong>: The passage suggests that to fully reap the
bone-related benefits of physical activity, several factors need to be
considered:
<ul>
<li>Hormone levels: Sufficient hormone levels, such as oestrogen in
women and testosterone in men, are necessary.</li>
<li>Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D: These nutrients are
crucial for bone health.</li>
<li>Sufficient total caloric intake: Meeting overall energy and
nutritional needs is important.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Reduced Cancer Risk</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cancer Prevention through Lifestyle Choices</strong>:
<ul>
<li>According to most cancer epidemiologists, 25 to 37 percent of
cancers can be avoided through healthier lifestyle and environmental
choices.</li>
<li>These choices include factors such as diet, physical activity, and
other environmental factors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sedentary Time and Cancer Risk</strong>: Recent research
suggests that high levels of sedentary time are associated with an
increased risk of several types of cancer.</li>
<li><strong>Contributions of Physical Inactivity and Diet</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The American Cancer Society reports that approximately 20 percent of
cancers are linked to physical inactivity and dietary choices.</li>
<li>Research indicates that regular physical activity and healthy diet
choices can prevent up to 30 percent of some cancers, with the specific
percentage varying depending on the type of cancer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Improved Weight Management</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Reason for Physical Activity</strong>: For many
individuals, the primary motivation for engaging in physical activity is
weight loss or maintaining a healthy weight.</li>
<li><strong>Calorie Expenditure</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Physical activity requires the body to expend calories for
energy.</li>
<li>When the number of calories expended through physical activity
exceeds the number of calories consumed over time, it results in weight
loss.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Elevated Metabolic Rate</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Engaging in physical activity, especially vigorous activities, leads
to an increase in metabolic rate.</li>
<li>This elevated metabolic rate can persist for several hours after
exercise and contributes to favorable changes in body composition that
support weight management.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Weight Maintenance and Prevention</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Regular physical activity is beneficial not only for losing weight
but also for maintaining weight loss.</li>
<li>For individuals at a healthy body weight, ongoing physical activity
can help prevent significant weight gain.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Improved Immunity</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immune System Enhancement</strong>: Regular
moderate-intensity physical activity has been shown to enhance the
body’s ability to fight infections. This means that individuals who
engage in regular exercise are less susceptible to diseases.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction in Inflammation</strong>: Regular exercise can
reduce inflammation in the body, which is associated with a higher risk
of chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Inflammation is a key factor in the development of these
conditions.</li>
<li><strong>J-Shaped Curve</strong>:</li>
<li>The relationship between physical activity and disease
susceptibility is often described as a J-shaped curve. It suggests that
moderate activity decreases susceptibility to disease.</li>
<li>However, susceptibility to disease may increase at extreme levels of
physical activity or exercise, or when exercise is performed without
adequate recovery time and dietary intake.</li>
<li><strong>Athletes and Infections</strong>: Athletes participating in
marathon-type events or very intense physical training programs may be
at a greater risk of upper respiratory tract infections in the immediate
hours after intense exercise sessions.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>The Psychological Benefits of Physical Activity</strong>
</summary>
<p><strong>Psychological Benefits for Clinical Populations</strong>: -
Physical activity has been associated with elevated mood among clinical
populations, such as those suffering from depression. - It is
recommended as a treatment for depression in various guidelines and
frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence from Randomized Controlled Trials</strong>: - A
meta-analysis of data from randomized controlled trials found a
significant reduction in depressive symptomatology among individuals
with depression who engaged in physical activity. - However, the effect
size reduced when analysing the most robust studies, suggesting that
well-controlled prospective studies are needed for more conclusive
results.</p>
<p><strong>Psychological Benefits for Non-Clinical Populations</strong>:
- Regular physical activity is associated with reduced anxiety and
depression and improved self-esteem and body image among non-clinical
populations. - Single episodes or limited-frequency aerobic exercise can
also elevate mood, boost self-esteem, and promote prosocial
behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Biological Mechanisms for Psychological Benefits</strong>: -
The psychological benefits of physical activity are attributed to
biological mechanisms, including the release of endorphins,
catecholamines (noradrenaline and adrenaline), and muscle relaxation. -
These mechanisms contribute to reducing pain, stress, and tension while
enhancing mood.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits for Children and Adolescents</strong>: - Qualitative
research among children and adolescents in Australia found that physical
activity provides various benefits, including social, cognitive, and
coping benefits. - Social benefits include fun, socializing, and team
work, while cognitive benefits encompass improved concentration and
stress reduction. - Physical activity also serves as an outlet for
frustration.</p>
<p><strong>Complex Relationship with Exercise Intensity</strong>: -
There’s evidence of an inverse relationship between exercise intensity
and adherence, suggesting that intense exercise may be perceived as
aversive and less likely to be maintained. - Some studies suggest that
intense exercise can lead to negative mood, but the timing of mood
assessments (pre- vs. post-exercise) can significantly influence the
findings. - Timing and methodological factors should be considered when
studying the relationship between exercise and mood.</p>
<strong>Factors Influencing Affective Experience</strong>: - Several
factors, including cognitive distraction, social support, and the
physical activity environment, can influence a person’s affective
experience during physical activity. - These factors may contribute to
stress coping, distraction from problems, and overall mood outcomes
associated with physical activity.
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Physical Activity and Cognitive Function</strong>
</summary>
<p><strong>Cognitive Benefits of Physical Activity</strong>: - Physical
activity may have psychological benefits for individuals with cognitive
decline, including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
dementia. - It is suggested that physical activity can improve certain
aspects of cognitive function relevant to daily living tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Neuroprotective Effects</strong>: - Physical activity is
believed to have neuroprotective effects, possibly through mechanisms
like increased cerebral blood flow. - Anatomical studies using MRI brain
scans have provided some evidence supporting these neurobiological and
vascular processes associated with exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Review of Evidence</strong>: - Barber, Clegg, and Young
(2012) conducted a review of evidence regarding the effects of exercise
on individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is
characterized by atypical cognitive decline for a person’s age and
education level and is a risk factor for dementia. - The review found
reasonable evidence from general population studies that compared
cognitive decline in physically active versus inactive individuals. -
Limited evidence from randomized controlled trials of physical activity
interventions also showed encouraging results.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance Training and Cognitive Function</strong>: - A
randomized controlled trial in Sydney (Singh et al., 2014) demonstrated
that resistance training significantly improved global cognitive
function in adults with mild cognitive impairment. - Interestingly, this
study found that resistance training was superior to cognitive training
in terms of cognitive function improvement.</p>
<strong>Moderation in Physical Activity</strong>: - While regular
physical activity is generally considered beneficial for physical and
psychological health, it’s suggested that moderation may be required, as
with many behaviours.
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Longer Lifespan</strong>
</summary>
<p><strong>Physical Activity and Longevity</strong>: - The relationship
between physical activity and longevity has been a topic of debate among
experts. - Several studies suggest that physical activity can lead to
significant decreases in long-term health risks and an increase in the
number of years lived. - These benefits are particularly evident among
individuals who have multiple risk factors for health issues and use
physical activity as a means of reducing those risks.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Physical Activity</strong>: - The greatest
benefits from physical activity are observed in sedentary individuals
who incorporate even a small amount of physical activity into their
lives. - As levels of physical activity increase, additional health
benefits are realized.</p>
<p><strong>Impact on Daily Living</strong>: - A sedentary lifestyle is
associated with a reduced ability to perform activities of daily living.
- The more time adults spend in sedentary activities, the greater the
reduction in their ability to carry out everyday tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Movement</strong>: It’s emphasized that it’s
not only structured exercise that matters but also the importance of
moving as much as possible and reducing the amount of time spent
sitting.</p>
<p><strong>Dose-Response Relationship</strong>: - There is a
dose-response relationship between physical activity and reduced risk of
various health issues, including cardiovascular disease, type 2
diabetes, and some forms of cancer. - This means that the greater the
frequency and intensity of physical activity, the greater the health
benefits.</p>
<strong>Example of Vigorous Activity</strong>: In a cohort study of
middle-aged and older Australian adults, engaging in vigorous activity
was associated with a 9% to 13% reduction in the risk of mortality, even
after adjusting for the total amount of activity.

<li>172(0.94) = 161.68 (upper target limit)</li>
<li>Target range = 111 to 162 beats per minute</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Calculate the target heart rate range by multiplying your estimated
maximal heart rate by 0.64 and 0.94.</li>
<li>Use target heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), or the
talk test to gauge intensity.</li>
<li>RPE scale: 6 (no exertion) to 20 (maximal exertion), with 12 to 16
recommended for cardiorespiratory training.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For cardiorespiratory fitness benefits:
<ul>
<li>Vigorous activities: At least 20 minutes per session.</li>
<li>Moderate activities: At least 30 minutes per session.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Minimum session duration: 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Total weekly goal: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes
of vigorous-intensity exercise.</li>
<li>Can combine moderate and vigorous activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Type:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any rhythmic, continuous, and physical activity lasting 20 minutes
or more improves cardiorespiratory fitness.</li>

<strong>FITT Principle for Muscular Strength and Endurance:</strong>
</summary>
<p><strong>Frequency:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Train major muscle groups 2 to 3 days a week.</li>
<li>Allow at least 1 day of rest between workouts targeting the same
muscle groups to allow for muscle recovery.</li>
<li>Avoid too much time between workouts to prevent deconditioning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intensity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Muscular strength is improved with resistance loads greater than 60%
of your 1 repetition max (1 RM).</li>
<li>Muscular endurance improves with loads less than 50% of your 1
RM.</li>
<li>To improve, overload muscles by creating tension greater than they
are accustomed to without causing injury or excessive fatigue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Measured in repetitions and sets.</li>
<li>For strength: Perform 8 to 12 repetitions per set with 2 to 4 sets
for general health and strength.</li>
<li>For endurance: Perform 15 to 25 repetitions per set with 1 to 2 sets
using resistance less than 50% of your 1 RM.</li>
<li>Rest periods of 2 to 3 minutes between exercises are recommended for
general health benefits.</li>
<li>Rest periods vary when working on strength or endurance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Type:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the body’s weight or devices with fixed or variable
resistance.</li>
<li>Select exercises for all major muscle groups to improve total body
strength.</li>
<li>Choose 8 to 10 exercises targeting all major muscle groups.</li>
<li>Pay attention to exercise order:
<ul>
<li>Large muscle group exercises before small muscle group
exercises.</li>
<li>Multiple-joint exercises before single-joint exercises.</li>
<li>High-intensity exercises before lower-intensity exercises.</li>

<strong>FITT principle for flexibility</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Flexibility training should be done a
minimum of 2 to 3 days per week.</li>
<li><strong>Intensity:</strong> Stretching should be performed at a
“point of mild tension” individually determined. Stretching should cause
tension or mild discomfort but not pain.</li>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> Hold each stretching position for 10 to 30
seconds. Repeat stretches 2 to 4 times in succession.</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stretch major muscle groups when the body is warm, ideally after
cardiorespiratory exercise.</li>
<li>Use static stretching, repeatedly stretching muscles and tendons to
increase range of motion.</li>
<li>Regular stretching leads to improved range of motion and

class="section level5">
<h5>Explain Why we need sleep and what happens if we don’t get enough
sleep, including potential physical, emotional, social and safety
threats to health</h5>
<p>Sleep serves to maintain your physical health, affects your ability
to function effectively, and enhances your intellectual, social,
emotional, and psychological health in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sleep restores you both physically and mentally:</strong>
Certain reparative chemicals are released while you sleep. There is also
evidence that during sleep, the brain is cleared of daily minutiae,
learning is synthesised, and memories are consolidated.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep conserves body energy:</strong> When you sleep, your
core body temperature and the rate at which you burn calories drop. This
leaves you with more energy to perform activities throughout your waking
hours.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep helps you cope with life’s challenges:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sleep helps you consolidate cognitive, physiological, and emotional
processes and autonomic functions.</li>
<li>Well-rested individuals tend to be happier, have more vigour in
their lives, and have a more positive outlook than do those who are
sleep deprived.</li>
<li>People who get enough rest are also more likely to control their
emotions and have more positive social interactions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Sleep and health</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sleep helps to maintain your immune system:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The common cold, strep throat, flu, mononucleosis, cold sores, and a
variety of other ailments are more common when your immune system is
depressed.</li>
<li>Lack of sleep weakens the immune system.</li>
<li>Adolescents getting more than 9 hours of sleep per night showed
improvements in markers of immune functioning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sleep helps to reduce your risk for cardiovascular
disease:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Recent studies have found links between increased risk of coronary
artery disease, risk of stroke, hypertension, metabolic syndrome,
obesity, and decreases in
<abbr title="HDL or ‘good cholesterol’">high-density lipoprotein</abbr>
levels and other disruptions in cholesterol metabolism, as well as
increases in other cardiovascular risks.</li>
<li>People with untreated sleep apnoea and night-time oxygen
deprivation, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, heart arrhythmias,
and heart failure risks increase dramatically in all age groups—even
among those who have otherwise healthy hearts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sleep contributes to a healthy metabolism:</strong>
<ul>
<li>**Metabolism* refers to the various chemical processes in our cells
that break down food and to obtain the compounds needed, with sleep
aiding these processes.</li>
<li>People who sleep less than 5 hours per night have a 40% higher risk
of developing obesity than do those who sleep 7 to 8 hours per
night.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Short sleep increases the risk of type 2 diabetes:</strong>
Sleep disorders such as sleep apnoea can increase the risk of T2D (a
disorder of glucose metabolism).</li>
<li><strong>Sleep may be a factor in male reproductive health:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Young males who suffered from chronic sleep deficits were shown to
have reduced semen concentration, reduced sperm quality and motility,
and smaller testicular size than men with higher sleep levels, while
women have increased issues with conception and overall fertility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sleep contributes to neurological/mental/cognitive
functioning:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Restricting sleep can cause a wide range of neurological problems,
including lapses of attention, slowed or poor memory, reduced cognitive
ability, difficulty concentrating, and a tendency for thinking to get
‘stuck in a rut’.</li>
<li>Sleep before and after a task improves performance and is important
to memory consolidation and retention.</li>
<li>Chronic lack of sleep may lead to early dementia and set the stage
for Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
<li>If you are awake, the brain is busy with other activity, and toxins
that cause problems may increase, while during deep sleep, the brain is
working to remove toxins.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sleep improves motor tasks, particularly driving:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sleep has been shown to have a restorative effect on motor function
(shooting a basket, playing a musical instrument, or driving a
car).</li>
<li>Motor function is affected by sleep throughout the life span among
otherwise healthy individuals.</li>
<li>Accident rates are 4 to 5 times higher in drivers after only 4 to 5
hours sleep, compared to those who get 7 to 8 hours (similar rates to
drunk drivers).</li>
<li>Drivers who get only 5 to 6 hours of sleep (compared to those who
get the recommended 7 to 8 hours) have over twice the risk of a
crash.</li>
<li>Drivers under the age of 26 are the most likely of any age group to
report falling asleep at the wheel within the last year, and men of all
ages are more likely to fall asleep than are women.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sleep plays a role in stress management and mental
health:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stress can cause or contribute to sleep problems, and sleep problems
can cause or increase your level of stress.</li>
<li>Reduced or poor-quality sleep can trigger depression and anxiety
disorders, but it’s also a common symptom resulting from them.</li>
<li>Individuals who suffer from chronic insomnia have over twice the
risk of developing depression.</li>

<h5>Explain the processes of sleep, including the two-stage model,
circadian rhythm, and the sleep-wake cycle, as well as how they work and
their importance of restful sleep.</h5>
<p><strong>Circadian Rhythm:</strong> refers to our biological clock or
24 hour cycle that monitors our sleep/wake patterns. Things like jet lag
can effect this process, disrupting our sleep patterns.
<strong>Melatonin:</strong> The chemical produced by the hypothalamus
and pineal gland used to regulate our circadian rhythm.</p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Parts of the brain involved in sleep</strong>
</summary>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Pineal Body:</em> Responsible for releasing the
drowsiness-inducing hormone called melatonin as light dims and the sun
goes down. During the day, the pineal gland is inactive and you remain
awake.</li>
<li><em>Retina:</em> Light travels through the retina and triggers
regulation of melatonin, slowing its production in daylight and
promoting production in darkness.</li>
<li><em>Pons:</em> The pons is a major message transmitter and is
responsible for much of what happens in our sleep-wake cycle. Unless
disrupted, the pons helps you enter REM sleep and keeps you down and
out, with muscles essentially immobilised.</li>
<li><em>Hypothalamus:</em> With parts that function as your body’s
clock, regulating your circadian rhythm, the hypothalamus stimulates the
pineal gland to secrete melatonin.</li>
<li><em>Pituitary Gland:</em> After being stimulated by the
hypothalamus, the pituitary gland releases human growth hormone,
signalling the body to repair worn tissues.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>The Two Stages of, and cycles of sleep</strong>
</summary>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>REM sleep:</em> Rapid eye movement and dreams occur, and
brain-wave activity appears similar to that when you are awake.</li>
<li><em>Non-REM (NREM) sleep:</em> the period of restful sleep with
slowed brain activity that does <em>not</em> include rapid eye
movement.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>During the night, you alternate between periods of NREM and REM
sleep, repeating one full cycle about once every 90 minutes.</li>
<li>Overall, you spend about 75 percent of each night in NREM sleep and
25 percent in REM sleep.</li>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Non-REM Sleep is restorative</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>During non-REM (slow-wave) sleep:
<ul>
<li>Both your body temperature and your energy use drop; sensation is
dulled; and your brain waves, heart rate, and breathing slow.</li>
<li>In contrast, digestive processes speed up, and your body stores
nutrients, you do not typically dream.</li>
<li>Four distinct stages of NREM sleep have been distinguished by their
characteristic brain-wave patterns as shown on an electroencephalogram
(EEG):
<ul>
<li><em>Stage 1:</em> is the lightest stage of sleep, lasts only a few
minutes, and involves the transition between waking and sleep.
<ul>
<li>Your brain begins to produces theta waves (slow brain waves), and
you may experience sensations of falling with quick, jerky muscle
reactions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Stage 2:</em> Your eyes close, body movement slows, and you
disengage from your environment.</li>
<li><em>Stages 3 and 4:</em>
<ul>
<li>Your brain generates slow, large-amplitude delta waves, blood
pressure drops, heart rate and respiration slow considerably, and you
enter deep sleep.</li>
<li>The hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary gland to release human
growth hormone, signalling the body to repair worn tissues.</li>
<li>Speech and movement are rare during stage 4 (but sometimes people
sleepwalk, cook, clean, or drive during this stage).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>REM Sleep Energises</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Dreaming takes place primarily during REM sleep.</li>
<li>On an EEG, a REM sleeper’s brain-wave activity is almost
indistinguishable from that of someone who is wide awake, and the
brain’s energy use is higher than that of a person performing a
difficult maths problem.</li>
<li>The pons, one of the smallest areas of the brain, is a major message
transmitter and is responsible for much of what happens in the
sleep-wake cycle.</li>
<li>Unless disrupted, the pons helps you enter REM sleep and keeps you
down and out, with muscles essentially immobilised.</li>
<li>You may dream that you’re rock climbing, but your body is incapable
of movement.</li>
<li>Almost the only exceptions are your respiratory muscles, which allow
you to breathe, and the tiny muscles of your eyes, which move your eyes
rapidly as if you were following the scenario of your dream.</li>
<li>Research indicates that deep phases of slow-wave sleep consolidate
and organise the day’s information, while REM sleep stabilises
consolidated memory.</li>
<li>Inappropriate levels of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep may cause your
short-term memory may suffer.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Sleep Needs</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Adults should sleep 7 or more hours each night to promote optimal
health.</li>
<li>Getting fewer than 7 hours of sleep per night on a regular basis
increases risks of adverse health outcomes.</li>
<li>Regularly getting more than 9 hours of sleep may be appropriate for
young adults, people trying to recover from sleep debt, and those
recovering from illness. For others, it’s not clear whether getting that
much sleep is associated with health risks.</li>
<li>Your gender, health, and lifestyle will also affect how much rest
your body demands.</li>
<li><em>Sleep patterns change over the lifespan:</em></li>
<li>Newborns need 16 to 18 hours of sleep daily.</li>
<li>Teens and younger adults need 8 to 9 hours per night, slightly more
than the adult average.</li>
<li>Older adults may experience sleep difficulties owing to health
conditions, pain, and the need to use the bathroom more frequently.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Sleep Debt</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Sleep debt refers to the total number of hours of missed sleep
you’re carrying around with you.</li>
<li>Accruing several days of sleep deprivation can make you sleepy,
affect your performance over a wide range of activities, lead to
inflammation, and negatively affect the immune system.</li>
<li>People with chronic sleep debt may have up to four times the risk of
catching the common cold or other illnesses.</li>
<li>Trying to catch up may make you feel more wide awake, as well as
reducing those dark circles and eye bags.</li>
<li>It also may reduce stress-related cortisol levels that shoot up
while you are sleep deprived.</li>
<li>Catch-up sleep is not likely to make much difference in your
performance levels, won’t restore your functioning, and is likely to
disrupt your circadian rhythm.</li>
<li>It’s best to work on establishing good sleep hygiene to help ensure
that you get a healthy amount of sleep throughout the week.</li>
<li><em>DEC2 gene:</em> Around 1% of individuals with this gene sleep
less and seem to experience few adverse affects, as they do not accrue
the negative consequences of typical sleep debt.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Napping</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Naps can’t entirely cancel out a significant sleep debt, they can
improve your mood, alertness, and possibly performance if your sleep
debt is more an occasional deficit than a chronic problem.</li>
<li>It’s best to nap in the early to mid afternoon, when the pineal body
in your brain releases a small amount of melatonin and your body
experiences a natural dip in its circadian rhythm.</li>
<li>Napping in the late afternoon could interfere with your ability to
fall asleep that night.</li>
<li>Keep your naps short, because a nap of more than 30 minutes can
leave you in a state of <em>sleep inertia</em>, which is characterised
by cognitive impairment, grogginess, queasiness, and a disoriented
feeling.</li>

<h5>Describe some common sleep disorders, including risk factors and
what can be done to prevent or treat them.</h5>
<ul>
<li>Sleep disorders (also known as <em>somnipathy</em> or
<em>dyssomnia</em>) are any medical disorders with a negative effect on
sleep patterns.</li>
<li>While millions of people don’t get enough sleep on any given night,
as many as 70 million people suffer from an actual sleep-related
disorder.</li>
<li>Over 61% of US college students aged 18 to 29 years report staying
awake late and getting up early—a recipe for sleep deprivation.</li>
<li>Although more than 4% of college students report having been treated
for insomnia, the vast majority go it alone when trying to get enough
sleep.</li>
<li>Nearly 2.5% of students report having sleep disorders other than
insomnia.</li>
<li>Nearly 29% of students say that they have had sleep difficulties in
the last year that were traumatic or difficult to handle.</li>
<li>In conjunction with a sleep diary, an overnight clinical sleep study
involves the use of sensors and electrodes to record data that will be
reviewed by a sleep specialist, who will work with you and your doctor
to diagnose and treat your sleep problem.</li>
<li>The American Academy of Sleep Medicine identifies more than 80 sleep
disorders.</li>

<summary>
<strong>Insomnia</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Insomnia is characterised by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent
arousals during sleep, or early morning awakening, and is the most
common sleep complaint.</li>
<li>Young adults aged 18 to 29 years experience the most insomnia
(around 68% reporting symptoms) often relating to depression, stress,
and anxiety.</li>
<li>Around 59% of adults aged 30 to 64 years experience regular
symptoms, with 44% of those over age 65 having symptoms.</li>
<li>Adults with children in the household tend to report more insomnia
symptoms than do those without children.</li>
<li>Approximately 10% to 15% of Americans have experienced chronic
insomnia that lasts longer than a month.</li>
<li>Nearly twice as many women as men experience symptoms of
insomnia.</li>
<li>Nearly 21% of students report that sleep difficulties are affecting
their academic performance, only about 5% of them report seeking
treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms and Causes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Symptoms include:
<ul>
<li>Difficulty falling asleep,</li>
<li>Waking up frequently during the night,</li>
<li>Difficulty returning to sleep,</li>
<li>Waking up too early in the morning,</li>
<li>Unrefreshing sleep,</li>
<li>Daytime sleepiness,</li>
<li>Trouble focusing, and</li>
<li>Irritability.</li>
<li>Hormonal changes or issues with the gastrointestinal tract or
bladder.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Often caused by:
<ul>
<li>Stress and worry,</li>
<li>Disrupted circadian rhythms (through travel across time zones, shift
work, and major schedule changes).</li>
<li>Excess stress can also be a key factor.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effects: </strong> Left untreated, long-term insomnia may be
associated with depression, drug and alcohol use, and heart disease.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is one of the
best first-line defences for people experiencing insomnia.</li>
<li>CBT-I helps people better understand the thoughts and feelings that
influence their behaviours and focuses on changing the habits that
disrupt sleep.</li>
<li>Strategies such as:
<ul>
<li>thought blocking,</li>
<li>thought refocusing,</li>
<li>learning to meditate,</li>
<li>listening to relaxing music,</li>
<li>biofeedback,</li>

<strong>Sleep Apnoea</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>A disorder in which breathing is briefly and repeatedly interrupted
during sleep.</li>
<li>Apnoea refers to a breathing pause that lasts at least 10
seconds.</li>
<li>Sleep apnoea affects more than 18 million Americans, or 1 in every
15 people.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms and Causes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are two major types of sleep apnoea:
<ul>
<li><strong>Central Sleep Apnoea: </strong> occurs when the brain fails
to tell the respiratory muscles to initiate breathing. Consumption of
alcohol, certain illegal drugs, and certain medications can contribute
to central sleep apnoea.</li>
<li><strong>Obstructive Sleep Apnoea: </strong> is more common and
occurs when air cannot move into and out of a person’s nose or mouth.
<ul>
<li>Throat muscles and tongue relax during sleep and block the airway,
causing snorting, snoring, and gagging.</li>
<li>Falling oxygen saturation levels in the blood stimulate the body’s
autonomic nervous system to trigger inhalation, often via a sudden gasp
of breath.</li>
<li>This response may wake the person, preventing deep sleep and causing
the person to awaken in the morning feeling as though he or she hasn’t
slept.</li>
<li>Most common in people who are overweight and/or have sagging
internal throat tissue, which puts them at higher risk for sleep
apnoea.</li>
<li>Other risk factors include smoking and alcohol use, being 40 years
of age or older, and ethnicity occurring at higher rates in African
Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics.</li>
<li>Anatomical risk factors for OSA can include a small upper airway (or
large tongue, tonsils, or uvula), a recessed chin, a small jaw or a
large overbite, and a large neck size.</li>
<li>Because OSA runs in some families, genetics may also play a
role.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effects:</strong> Higher risks for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic high blood pressure,</li>
<li>Irregular heartbeat,</li>
<li>Heart attack,</li>
<li>Stroke,</li>
<li>Increase the risk of type 2 diabetes,</li>
<li>Immune system deficiencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The most effective method for preventing and treating sleep apnoea
is to lose weight, along with avoiding some of the factors that appear
to increase risk.</li>
<li>The most commonly prescribed therapy for OSA is continuous positive
airway pressure (CPAP).</li>
<li>CPAP involves the use of a machine consisting of an airflow device,
a long flexible tube, and a mask.</li>
<li>The mask is worn during sleep with air forced into the nose to keep
the airway open.</li>
<li>The FDA recently approved an implantable upper airway stimulator
(UAS) called Inspire for use by people who cannot tolerate CPAP
devices.</li>
<li>Implanted under the skin in the upper chest, Inspire is a small
pulsing device that stimulates airway muscle action and improved
breathing and can be programmed remotely by a doctor.</li>
<li>It is turned on before bed each night and turned off in the morning
(as with the CPAP).</li>
<li>Other methods for treating OSA include dental appliances (which
reposition the lower jaw and tongue, and surgery to remove tissue in the
upper airway).</li>
<li>In general, these approaches are most helpful for mild disease or
snoring; they may not be as effective with severe sleep apnoea.</li>
</ul>

<summary>
<strong>Restless Legs Syndrome</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder
characterised by unpleasant sensations in the legs when at rest combined
with an uncontrollable urge to move in an effort to relieve these
feelings.</li>
<li>The sensations range in severity from mildly uncomfortable to
painful.</li>
<li>Some researchers estimate that RLS affects over 10 percent of the
U.S. population, with increasing diagnosis in all age groups.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms and Causes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RLS is often described as burning, creeping, or tugging or like
insects crawling inside the legs.</li>
<li>Symptoms are generally more pronounced in the evening or at
night.</li>
<li>Lying down or trying to relax activates the symptoms, and moving the
legs relieves the discomfort, so people with RLS often have difficulty
falling and staying asleep.</li>
<li>While the cause of RLS is unknown, a family history of the condition
is seen in approximately 50 percent of cases, suggesting some genetic
link.</li>
<li>RLS can be related to other conditions, including Parkinson’s
disease, kidney failure, diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and
anaemia.</li>
<li>Pregnancy or hormonal changes can worsen symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If there is an underlying condition, treatment of that condition may
provide relief.</li>
<li>Other treatment options include use of prescribed medications,
decreasing tobacco and alcohol use, applying heat to the legs, and
relaxation techniques or stretching exercises can alleviate
symptoms.</li>
</ul>

<summary>
<strong>Narcolepsy</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder caused by the brain’s
inability to properly regulate sleep-wake cycles.</li>
<li>The result is excessive, intrusive sleepiness and daytime sleep
attacks.</li>
<li>Narcolepsy occurs in about 1 of every 3000 people.</li>
<li>Narcolepsy is not rare, but it is under recognised and under
diagnosed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms and Causes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Narcolepsy is characterised by overwhelming and uncontrollable
sleepiness during the day.</li>
<li>Narcoleptics are prone to falling asleep at inappropriate times and
places (in class, at work, while driving or eating, or even in the
middle of a conversation).</li>
<li>Sleep attacks can last from a few seconds to several minutes.</li>
<li>Other symptoms include:
<ul>
<li>Cataplexy (the sudden loss of voluntary muscle tone, often triggered
by emotional stimuli),</li>
<li>Hallucinations during sleep onset or on awakening, and</li>
<li>Brief episodes of paralysis during sleep-wake transitions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In most cases, narcolepsy appears to be caused by a deficiency of
sleep-regulating chemicals in the brain, with genetics potentially
playing a role.</li>
<li>Other possible factors include having another sleep disorder, using
certain medications, or having a mental disorder or substance abuse
disorder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Narcolepsy is commonly treated with medications that improve
alertness, and antidepressants may be prescribed to treat cataplexy,
hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.</li>
<li>Behavioural therapy can help narcoleptics cope with their
condition.</li>
<li>Some lifestyle changes, such as scheduling brief naps during the day
or eating smaller meals on a regular schedule may be helpful.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Circadian Rhythm Disorder:</em> Abnormalities in the
sleep-wake cycle due to jet lag and adjustments to shift work;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sleep Phase Disorder:</em> The person either wakes up or goes
to sleep too early;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sleep-related Eating Disorder:</em> The person may be found

<h5>Explore ways to improve your sleep through changing daily habits,
modifying your environment, avoiding sleep disruptors, adopting
mindfulness sleep strategies, and using other sound sleep hygiene
approaches.</h5>
<p><strong>Sleep hygiene</strong> refers to the wide range of practices
that can help you create and maintain normal, good quality night time
sleep and full daytime alertness.</p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Create a sleep-promoting environment</strong>
</summary>
<p><strong>Chill</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The best sleep occurs in a cool bedroom, at around 18 degrees.</li>
<li>Normally, as you get sleepy, your body temperature starts to drop,
and the body conserves energy through most of the sleeping hours,
gradually increasing your temperature just before dawn.</li>
<li>As light hits your room, your body temperature goes up along with
your energy levels as part of normal circadian rhythms.</li>
<li>Higher temperatures may interfere with your natural body rhythms,
making it harder to enter or remain in deep sleep, with resultant
insomnia and other problems.</li>
<li>Everyone has an ideal sleep temperature based on percent body fat
and other metabolic differences; finding out what seems to work best for
you in different temperature and humidity situations is key to the
environmental regulation of sleep.</li>
<li>If you and your partner or room-mate run hot and cold in ideal sleep
temperatures, finding a good compromise temperature can help you both
maintain sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Create a sleep ‘cave’</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As bedtime approaches, keep your bedroom quiet, calm, and dark with
sensory stimuli at a minimum.</li>
<li>Avoid exposure to bright light, particularly blue light, by turning
off electronic devices or wearing an eye mask.</li>
<li>Blue light is a key factor in our secretion of melatonin, a sleep
hormone.</li>
<li>If you get a lot of blue-light exposure from that glowing phone or
tablet screen or from a computer monitor or TV in your room, your
melatonin production will drop, and you may find it hard to fall asleep
or stay asleep.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Associate bed with sleep</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make your bed a place for comfort and relaxation. A place for you to
get the sleep you need to be productive and healthy; it shouldn’t serve
as your office or your social media centre.</li>
<li>You should spend a third of your time sleeping, so invest in a good
mattress, and buy sheets that are smooth, cool, and relaxing and pillows
that are right for you.</li>
<li>Wash your bedding weekly or biweekly, and keep your bedroom clean
and smelling fresh.</li>
<li>Get rid of clutter, and keep things organised.</li>
<li>Free yourself from intrusions by turning off the ringer on your
phone, and charge your mobile phone or tablet in a place that is out of
reach so that you aren’t tempted to look at it during sleep time.</li>
<li>If you must have a TV in your bedroom, set it to turn off after an
hour, and put the remote far from your bed so you aren’t tempted to turn
the TV back on.</li>
<li>Go to bed only when you are tired.</li>
<li>If you get in bed and can’t sleep within 20 to 30 minutes, get up,
keep the lights dim, and listen to relaxing music or meditate.</li>
<li>Don’t get into heavy studying on your computer or try to memorise
complex details for an exam, and don’t watch TV or grab your phone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Establish bedtime and waking rituals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to bed and get up at the same times each day.</li>
<li>Establishing a bedtime ritual signals to your body that it’s time
for sleep.</li>
<li>Listen to a quiet song, practise meditation and deep-breathing
exercises, take a warm shower, or read something that lets you quietly
wind down.</li>
<li>On awakening, make your bed and air out your room.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Adjust Your Daytime Habits</strong>
</summary>
<p><strong>Get adequate daytime light exposure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Light is the best tool for controlling your internal clock. Light
travels through the retina and regulates melatonin, slowing its
production in daylight and encouraging it in darkness, helping to
regulate the sleep-wake cycle. If you want to stay awake in the daytime
and sleep at night, get as much exposure to natural light outdoors
during the day as you can.</li>
<li>Open your blinds.</li>
<li>Look for lamps and light bulbs that are recommended as therapy for
seasonal affective disorder to help with daytime alertness.</li>
<li>Increase your exposure to light and can help protect against other
problems on dark winter days, where daylight is in short supply.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise in the morning or afternoon</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise 3 to 4 hours before you go to bed.</li>
<li>Exercise accelerates your metabolism, makes you more alert, and
depletes energy stores while raising body temperature, however, it takes
hours to bring physiological changes down.</li>
<li>Set a cut off time for relaxing and cooling off the body for optimum
sleep.</li>
<li>Take time out for yourself.</li>
<li>If you must walk the dog or want to go for a walk before bed or in
the evening, keep it to a slow, mindful stroll.</li>
<li>Don’t allow your mind to wander to problems you face or get worked
up over assignments or upcoming tests.</li>
<li>Focus on you and the moment and the sights and sounds around
you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Watch your diet, particularly in the hours before
bed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid eating heavy meals within 2 to 3 hours of bedtime.</li>
<li>Foods containing Tryptophan (an amino acid):
<ul>
<li>Encourages sleepiness, particularly on an empty stomach.</li>
<li>Found in nut butters, bananas, tuna, eggs, chicken, turkey, yoghurt,
milk, and pork.</li>
<li>Also found in high-carbohydrate foods such as bread and
pastries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Foods that are high in protein and contain tyramine (such as
sausage, eggplant, bacon, raspberries, chocolate, avocado, nuts, soy,
and red wine) and greasy or spicy foods may keep you awake.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Common sleep disruptors</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><em>Caffeine:</em> Can be bad news for your sleep, particularly when
consumed in the late afternoon or evening.</li>
<li><em>Nicotine, Alcohol, and Liquids:</em> will increase the
likelihood of sleep disturbances. Alcohol effects the deep levels of
sleep, while heavy consumption of any liquids late in the day, can lead
to <em>nocturia</em> (over-active bladder).</li>
<li><em>Screen Time:</em> keep your mind alert and expose you to blue
light, decreasing melatonin production.</li>
<li><em>Sources of Conflict:</em> Avoid late-night phone calls, texts,
or e-mails that can end up in arguments, dis-appointments, and other
emotional stressors.</li>

Disease and Sexual Health</h3>

<h4>Topic 1</h4>
<div
id="describe-the-process-of-infection-and-the-factors-that-increase-your-risk-for-infectious-diseases."
class="section level5">
<h5>Describe the process of infection and the factors that increase your
risk for infectious diseases.</h5>
<ul>
<li>Most infectious diseases are <em>multifactorial</em>, that is,
caused by the interaction of several factors inside and outside the
person.</li>
<li>For an infection to occur, three key conditions known as the
<em>epidemiological triad</em> of disease must be met.</li>
<li>First, the host (the person) must come into contact with a pathogen
(infectious agent) that is virulent enough to overcome the body’s
elaborate defences.</li>
<li>The pathogen must also be capable of sustaining itself long enough
to cause an infection in a healthy person, or, in an opportunistic
infection, a normal pathogen overcomes an immunocompromised (weakened or
non-functional) immune system.</li>
<li>Second, the host must be susceptible, or in some way vulnerable to
infection.</li>
<li>As an example, a person on antirejection drugs after an organ
transplant may be severely immunocompromised and would be vulnerable to
any number of pathogens, be they lurking in a hospital room or carried
in on well-wishing visitors.</li>
<li>Third, the environment must be hospitable to the pathogen in terms
of temperature, light, moisture, and other requirements.</li>
<li>Although pathogens pose a threat if they gain entry and begin to
grow in your body, the chances that they will do serious, long-term harm
are normally quite small.</li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Routes of transmission</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Pathogens may enter the body by direct contact between infected
persons or by indirect contact, such as touching an object an infected
person has touched.</li>
<li>You may also auto inoculate yourself, or transmit a pathogen from
one part of your body to another (i.e by touching a herpes sore on your
lip with a finger and then touching your eye with that finger.</li>
<li>Dogs, cats, livestock, and wild animals can directly or indirectly
spread infections to each other and to humans, known as animal-borne
(zoonotic) infections.</li>
<li>Companion animals such as cats and dogs can carry fleas and ticks
into homes; when these insects bite humans, diseases such as Lyme
disease can occur.</li>
<li>Untreated puppies and dogs can be infested with worms that can be
transmitted to humans via saliva or through faecal residue on bedding,
household carpets, or furniture. Every year, pet outbreaks send
thousands of people to their veterinarian, worried about their pet and
about whether they themselves might get a disease from their
animals.</li>
<li>Although you can get some illnesses from your pet, such as certain
forms of influenza, salmonellosis, leptospirosis, and rabies,
interspecies transmission is fairly rare, owing to vaccination of pets,
basic hygiene, and using care in contacting animal fluids.</li>
<li>Washing your hands after contact with pets, keeping your pets off
your pillow, and not letting your dog share your ice cream cone are
important examples of prevention.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Risk Factors of Disease</strong>
</summary>
<p><strong>Risk factors you can control</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The risk of contracting many diseases is governed by:
<ul>
<li>Too much stress,</li>
<li>poor diet,</li>
<li>low fitness level,</li>
<li>lack of sleep,</li>
<li>misuse or abuse of drugs,</li>
<li>poor personal hygiene,</li>
<li>unprotected sex,</li>
<li>Close living conditions (university students),</li>
<li>Isolating yourself when you are sick,</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The skills for behaviour change box lists some actions you can take
to minimise your risk of infection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hard to Control Risk Factors</strong></p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Heredity</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>It is often unclear whether hereditary diseases are due to inherited
genetic traits or to inherited insufficiencies in the immune
system.</li>
<li>If we inherit the quality of our immune system, some people are
naturally more resistant or more susceptible to infection and
disease.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Age</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Thinning of the skin, reduced sweating, and other physical changes
can make people more susceptible to disease as they age.</li>
<li>Older adults and very young children are particularly
vulnerable.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Environmental conditions</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>A growing body of research points to climate change as a major
contributor to infectious diseases.</li>
<li>As temperatures rise, insect populations may rise, potentially
increasing cases of mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile virus,
malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya virus, and others.</li>
<li>Dwindling water supplies where there is little water turnover or
flow contribute to an environment that fosters pathogen growth.</li>
<li>When animals move to new environments in search of water and
congregate near water sources, they are exposed to new species of
animals with a new set of pathogens. In these environments, disease
spreads quickly.</li>
<li>Scientists argue that changing environmental conditions such as
drought, flooding, fires, and other natural and human-caused events may
increase disease spread and hasten the chances of interspecies
transmission in humans.</li>
<li>Chronic exposure to toxic chemicals in pesticides, herbicides,
mercury, and lead and other threats such as radiation exposure can
damage the immune system and increase disease susceptibility.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Organism virulence and resistance</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>A highly virulent organism can outlast our immune systems at their
strongest.</li>
<li>Other organisms have mutated and become resistant to medical
treatments (COVID-19).</li>
<li>This kind of <em>drug resistance</em> (in a similar way to an addict
building a drug tolerance) occurs when pathogens grow and proliferate in
the presence of chemicals that would normally slow their growth or kill
them.</li>

<h5>Explain how your immune system protects you, factors that diminish
its effectiveness, and what you can do to boost its effectiveness.</h5>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Physical and chemical defences</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Our skin is an intricate web of barriers (our most critical early
defence system), allowing few pathogens to enter.</li>
<li>Body secretions such as sweat produce enzymes, destroying
micro-organisms on skin surfaces to create inhospitable pH levels.</li>
<li>Pathogens can only gain access to our bodies through cracks or
breaks in the skin.</li>
<li>The are a number of internal linings, structures, and secretions of
the body providing further protection:
<ul>
<li>Mucous membranes in the respiratory tract, for example, trap and
engulf invading organisms.</li>
<li>Cilia, hair-like projections in the lungs and respiratory tract,
sweep invaders toward body openings, where they are expelled.</li>
<li>Nose hairs trap airborne invaders with a sticky film.</li>
<li>Tears, earwax, and other secretions contain enzymes that destroy or
neutralise pathogens.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>The Immune System</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Immunity is a condition of being able to resist a particular disease
by counteracting the substance that produces the disease.</li>
<li>An <em>antigen</em> is any substance that is capable of triggering
an immune response: a virus, bacterium, fungus, parasite, toxin, tissue
or cell from another organism, or even chemicals from the
environment).</li>
<li>When a pathogen breaches the initial external defences, the body
first analyses the antigen, verifying that it isn’t part of the body
itself.</li>
<li>It then responds by forming antibodies specific to that antigen,
much as a key is matched to a lock.</li>
<li>These antibodies are designed to destroy or weaken the antigen. This
process is part of a system called humoural immune responses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Humoural Immune Responses</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In cell-mediated immunity, specialised white blood cells called
lymphocytes attack and destroy the foreign invader.</li>
<li>Lymphocytes constitute the body’s main defence against viruses,
fungi, parasites, and some bacteria; they are found in the blood, lymph
nodes, bone marrow, and certain glands.</li>
<li>Another key player in this immune response are macrophages (a type
of phagocytic, or cell-eating, white blood cell).</li>
<li>Two forms of lymphocytes in particular, the B lymphocytes (B cells)
and T lymphocytes (T cells), are involved in the immune response.</li>
<li>Helper T cells are essential for activating B cells to produce
antibodies.</li>
<li>They also activate other T cells and macrophages.</li>
<li>Killer T cells directly attack infected or malignant cells.</li>
<li>Suppressor T cells turn off or suppress the activity of B cells,
killer T cells, and macrophages.</li>
<li>After a successful attack on a pathogen, some attacker T and B cells
are preserved as memory T and B cells, enabling the body to recognise
and respond quickly to subsequent attacks by the same kind of
organism.</li>
<li>Once having survived certain infectious diseases, a person will
likely not develop these diseases again.</li>
</ol>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Autoimmune Diseases</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>An autoimmune disease is where the process for recognising and
ignoring the body’s own cells goes awry, and the immune system targets
its own tissues (auto means ‘self’).</li>
<li>There are over 80 different types of autoimmune diseases that affect
humans, and millions of new cases occur each year.</li>
<li>The presence of auto antibodies can indicate autoimmunity, in many
cases well before the symptoms of autoimmune diseases actually
begin.</li>
<li>Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, and
multiple sclerosis are some common autoimmune disorders.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Inflammatory Response, Pain and Fever</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>If an infection is localised, pus formation, redness, swelling, and
irritation often occur. These symptoms are components of the body’s
inflammatory response and indicate that the invading organisms are being
fought.</li>
<li>The four cardinal signs of inflammation are:
<ul>
<li>redness,</li>
<li>swelling,</li>
<li>pain, and</li>
<li>heat.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pathogens kill or injure tissue at the site of infection, causing
swelling that puts pressure on nerve endings in the area, resulting in
pain.</li>
<li>Pain causes a person to avoid activity that may aggravate the injury
and cause additional damage.</li>
<li>Fever (body temperature above 37<span
class="math inline">\(^\text{o}\)</span> C), stimulates the body to
produce more white blood cells In addition to inflammation, another
frequent indicator of infection is fever, or a .</li>
<li>Toxins secreted by pathogens interfere with the control of body
temperature, as a measure to kill some disease causing organisms. As
fever increases, more pathogens are destroyed.</li>
<li>A mild fever is protective; raising the body temperature by one or
two degrees provides an environment that destroys some disease-causing
organisms.</li>
<li>For babies and small children, when a fever goes higher than 38.3°
attention should be sought.</li>
<li>In adults, when fevers rise above 39.5<span
class="math inline">\(^\text{o}\)</span> C, medical attention is
warranted.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Vaccines Bolster Immunity</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Vaccination is based on the principle that our bodies will be able
to fight off a pathogen once our immune system has responded to the
pathogen successfully.</li>
<li>A vaccine is a dead or less virulent instance of a disease,
introducing a microorganism or an antigen that is similar to, but less
dangerous than the disease antigen.</li>
<li>The dose given produces antibodies against future attacks—without
actually causing the disease (or by causing a very minor case of
it).</li>
<li>Immunity can be referred to as either active or passive:
<ul>
<li><em>Artificially acquired active immunity:</em> Vaccines given
orally or by injection.</li>
<li><em>Naturally acquired active immunity:</em> which is obtained by
exposure to antigens in the normal course of daily life.</li>
<li><em>Naturally acquired passive immunity:</em> Occurs when a mother
passes immunity to her foetus via their shared blood supply or to an
infant via breast milk.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Concern about the safety of vaccines has led to a drop in
vaccination rates, and an increase in serious diseases such as the
measles and pertussis.</li>
<li>Australian childhood vaccine schedules are available at the
Australian Government Department of Health website under the National
Immunisation Program Schedule. - Vaccines that should be a <em>high
priority</em> among 20-somethings include:
<ul>
<li>tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine (dTpa),</li>
<li>meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY),</li>
<li>vaccine against the human papillo-mavirus (HPV), and</li>
<li>the influenza vaccine.</li>

<summary>
<strong>Bacteria</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Bacteria (singular: bacterium) are simple, single-celled
organisms.</li>
<li>There are three major types of bacteria, classified by shape: cocci,
bacilli, and spirilla.</li>
<li>Although there are several thousand known species of bacteria, they
(and the toxins they produce) cause just over 100 human diseases.</li>
<li>Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin in 1928, bacteria were
in a losing battle with their enemy: antibiotics.</li>
<li>With each decade thereafter, newer, more potent, and more
specialised antibiotics decimated generation after generation of
bacterial diseases.</li>
<li>Doctors prescribe antibiotics for conditions they were not designed
to treat and many patients do not take even necessary antibiotics as
instructed.</li>
<li>As a result of this generations of bacteria survived, mutated,
changed, and developed into ‘superbugs’, able to overcome many of the
antibiotics intended to treat them.</li>
<li><em>Antibiotic/antimicrobial resistance:</em> the ability of
microbes to resist the effects of drugs, to grow and proliferate, even
in the face of our best weapons—is one of the world’s most pressing
problems, with over 2 million people infected and 23 000 deaths per year
in the United States alone.</li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Staphylococcal infections</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Staphylococci are present on the skin or in the nostrils of 20 to 30
percent of us at any given time.</li>
<li>The presence of bacteria on or in a person without infection is
called colonisation, and they usually cause no problems for otherwise
healthy people.</li>
<li>A colonised person may spread the bacteria to other people, some of
whom may develop infections, yet the colonised person may never develop
the disease.</li>
<li>Colonised individuals can inadvertently touch their noses and spread
bacteria from the nose onto a door handle, causing people who touch the
handle to get sick.</li>
<li>Infection develops via a cut or break in the skin, allowing the
bacteria to enter the body.</li>
<li>If you have ever suffered from acne, boils, styes (infections of the
eyelids), or infected wounds, you have probably had a ‘staph’
infection.</li>
<li>If you pick at pimples and don’t wash your hands, you can transmit
those same bacteria to your eyes or to other people.</li>
<li>The simple act of washing your hands after flossing or using the
toilet can prevent transmission of the same bacteria to other
people.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus
(MRSA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As the name implies, this bacteria has grown resistant to the class
of drugs normally used to treat staph infections.</li>
<li>Symptoms of MRSA infection often start with a rash or a pimple-like
skin irritation.</li>
<li>Within hours, early symptoms may progress to redness, inflammation,
pain, and deeper wounds.</li>
<li>If untreated, MRSA may invade the blood, bones, joints, surgical
wounds, heart valves, and lungs, and it can be fatal.</li>
<li>Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is on the rise in homes,
workplaces, and other places in the communities where we live.</li>
<li>Although the exact number of people with CA-MRSA is not known,
studies show that 1 in 3 people harbour staph bacteria in their nose,
most of the time without any signs of illness.</li>
<li>Two percent of people carry MRSA.</li>
<li>Often, CA-MRSA appears as a skin infection that becomes red,
inflamed, and painful and may be filled with pus or fluids.</li>
<li>The initial irritated spot may be mistaken for a spider bite or boil
or an infection due to a cut or other injury.</li>
<li>Although it can occur anywhere, irritation often appears in the
groin area, beard, buttocks, underarm, or scalp.</li>
<li>Because the initial site of infection may mimic other things, many
people with CA-MRSA delay treatment and unknowingly infect other
people.</li>
<li>Prevention of CA-MRSA involves keeping the hands away from the nose
(since the nose often harbours the staph organism); good personal
hygiene; and not sharing razors, towels, pillows, or other personal
products.</li>
<li>Careful attention to unusual sores on the body is key to risk
reduction.</li>
<li>A type of MRSA that appears to spread among people who work closely
with livestock in other countries is known as livestock-associated MRSA,
or LA-MRSA.</li>

<strong>Clostridium difficile (C-diff)</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Symptoms include:

<li>fever,</li>
<li>pain,</li>

<strong>Streptococcal infections</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>At least five types of the Streptococcus microorganism are known to
cause bacterial infections.
<ul>
<li><em>Group A streptococci (GAS)</em> cause streptococcal pharyngitis
(‘strep throat’) and scarlet fever, (One particularly virulent group of
GAS can lead to a rare but serious disease called necrotising fasciitis
OR ‘flesh-eating strep’).</li>
<li><em>Group B streptococci</em> can cause illness in newborn babies,
pregnant women, older adults, and adults with illnesses such as diabetes
or liver disease.
<ul>
<li>Because about 1 in 4 pregnant women have group B strep in their
rectum or vagina, the CDC recommends testing for it in the last weeks of
pregnancy.</li>
<li>Expectant mothers who are group B positive can be treated with
antibiotics to prevent problems in their newborn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The species Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for thousands of
cases of bacterial meningitis and pneumonia each year and is the primary
culprit in most ear infections.</li>
<li>Although antibiotic treatments are still effective, an increasing
number of cases are becoming resistant.</li>

<strong>Meningitis</strong>
</summary>
<p>Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the protective
membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. There are a variety
of causes, including bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections,
as well as non-infectious causes such as trauma to the brain, cancer,
lupus, drugs, or brain surgery. One virulent form of bacterial
meningitis that is prevalent on university campuses, meningococcal
meningitis is among the most serious. Spread through contact with
saliva, nasal discharge, faeces, or respiratory and throat secretions,
it is highly contagious. Sharing eating utensils, drinking glasses,
cigarettes, and vaping devices, kissing, and not covering your mouth and
nose when you cough or sneeze are common ways of infecting others.
Globally, meningococcal meningitis results in death within 24 to 48
hours for between 5 and 10 percent of those infected, despite treatment.
Up to 20 percent of infected individuals are left with neurological
issues. In Australia in 2016 there were 248 hospital admissions for
meningococcal disease. In 2003, the Meningococcal C vaccine was
introduced into the Australian National Immunisation Program (NIP). In
2016, there were 13 deaths due to meningococcal disease in Australia.
Children, adolescents, and young adults between 16 and 23 years old are
among the most likely to be infected and to have serious
complications.</p>
<p>Bacterial meningitis progresses rapidly; can cause brain dam-age,
hearing loss, and death; and needs immediate medical attention. Viral
meningitis is much less dangerous, and symptoms usually diminish in 3 to
5 days in otherwise healthy people. There is no vaccine or treatment for
viral meningitis. Fortunately, vaccines exist for pneumococcal
meningitis, the most common form of bacterial meningitis, and
meningococcal meningitis. The other vaccine-preventable form of
bacterial meningitis is Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Most
campuses require vaccinations against four forms of the disease;
however, requirements vary by state. The strain of organism present on
your campus might not be one you are vaccinated against. Check with your
health centre for more information, and see your immunisation table for
more information about vaccines.</p>
<p>Typical signs of meningitis are sudden fever, severe headache, and a
stiff neck, particularly stiffness that causes difficulty touching your
chin to your chest. People who are suspected of having meningitis should
receive immediate, aggressive medical treatment. Talk to the
professionals at your student health centre to learn what vaccine may
protect people in your area.</p>
Prevention of meningitis involves universal infection control
behaviours: - Frequent hand washing; - Sneezing into your arm; - Using
disposable tissues rather than reusable handkerchiefs; - Keeping your
hands away from your nose; and - Keeping ‘high touch’ surfaces (phones,
door-knobs, etc.).

<strong>Evidence of health differentials</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The 2016 report from the WHO, reports that almost all the countries
whose populations experience the shortest life expectancy are in
Africa.</li>
<li>Children in developing countries are 10 times more likely to die
before the age of 5 than children in developed countries.</li>
<li>The countries with the best health are scattered around the world:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Spain</li>
<li>Singapore</li>
<li>Switzerland</li>
<li>Japan</li>
<li>Australia (life expectancy of 82.8 years)</li>
<li>USA (31<span class="math inline">\(^{st}\)</span> at 79.3
years)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>It is generally, but not universally true that the populations of
rich nations live longer than those of the poor nations.</li>
<li>Of note is that the richest country in the world, the USA, fared
rather badly in the WHO rankings, at only 31st place, with a life
expectancy of 79.3 years.</li>
<li>A number of explanations for this apparent anomaly include the
following, some of which are considered in more depth later in the
chapter:
<ul>
<li>Some social groups within the USA have health that is more
characteristic of developing countries rather than rich industrialised
ones.</li>
<li>HIV has contributed to a higher proportion of death and disability
to young and middle-aged Americans than in most other industrialised
countries.</li>
<li>The USA is one of the leading countries for cancers relating to
tobacco use, especially lung cancer and chronic lung disease.</li>
<li>The USA has high levels of violence, especially homicides, compared
to other industrialised countries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The factors that contribute to these differences are economic,
environmental and social:
<ul>
<li>Developing countries experience lack of safe water, poor sanitation,
inadequate diet, indoor smoke from solid fuels and poor access to
healthcare.</li>
<li>52% of all deaths in low-income countries in 2015 were caused by:
<ul>
<li>Communicable diseases,</li>
<li>Maternal causes (i.e. conditions arising during pregnancy and
childbirth), and</li>
<li>Nutritional deficiencies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Less than 7% of deaths in high-income countries were due to such
causes.</li>
<li>The WHO estimates that poverty causes around 12 million deaths each
year in <em>children</em> under 5 living in the developing world, with
the most common causes of death being:
<ul>
<li>diarrhoea,</li>
<li>dysentery and</li>
<li>lower respiratory tract infections.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Major killers among the <em>adult</em> population include:
<ul>
<li>being underweight,</li>
<li>tuberculosis and</li>
<li>malaria.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Death through infection contrasts with <em>industrialised
nations</em>, where the key causes of death are:
<ul>
<li>chronic disease and</li>
<li>abuse of drugs such as tobacco and alcohol.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Swaziland, Lesotho and Botswana have HIV infection rates of 22% or
higher.</li>
<li>An estimated 13.4 million children and adolescents (0–17 years)
worldwide had lost one or both parents to AIDS as of 2015.</li>
<li>More than 80% of these children (10.9 million) live in sub-Saharan
Africa.</li>
<li>War is also a significant contributor to early mortality in many
developing countries.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Even the ‘haves’ experience health differentials</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>There are gradients of wealth within the western countries, and
differentials in health that match them.</li>
<li>The richer people within most industrialised countries are likely to
live longer than the less well-off and be healthier while alive.</li>
<li>Life expectancy in the lowest socio-economic areas of Australia is
about 3 years less, with multiple chronic health conditions about 1.6
times more likely, and are three times as likely to smoke.</li>
<li>Avoidable deaths attributable to smoking, alcohol consumption, diet
and exercise are 1.8 times higher in the lowest socio-economic areas
than in the highest.</li>
<li>Researchers suggest that if all Australians were considered part of
the same SES localities, the mortality of 23 000 deaths could have been
avoided between 1998 and 2000.</li>
<li>In the case of 68,686 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1982
to 2007 death was 34–40% higher for men living in lower SES areas than
in higher ones.</li>
<li>The life expectancy of individuals living in 8797 specified areas of
the UK based on measured levels of household overcrowding, male
unemployment, low social class and car ownership estimated a 13.2 year
difference between those in the least and most deprived areas.</li>
<li>The relationship between social deprivation and health is linear,
indicating that the very poor die earlier than the rich, and modest
differences in wealth can influence health throughout society.</li>
<li>Middle-class UK executives who owned one car were more likely to die
earlier than their peers who had two cars.</li>

<summary>
<strong>Social causation versus social drift</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Explanations for socio-economic health differentials pit social
explanations against more individual ones:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>social causation model</strong> suggests that there is
something about occupying a low socio-economic group that adversely
influences the health of individuals.
<ul>
<li>A recent report found that families in which the main earner was
experiencing poor health were more likely to be in poverty in comparison
to families not experiencing poor health.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <strong>social drift model</strong> suggests that developing a
health problem, may prevent us from holding a job or the work rate
required to maintain their standard of living, drifting down the
socio-economic scale.
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>The head of families who were experiencing poverty this year more
likely to experience ill health in the next year, compared to a family
head whose family was not in poverty.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Baseline measures of SES predict subsequent health status, while
health status is less able to predict SES.</li>
<li>SES is generally seen as a cause of differences in health status
rather than a consequence.</li>
<li><em>Social causation Model:</em> As people move from employment to
unemployment as a result of factors unrelated to their health, many
people’s health deteriorates and mortality among older individuals
increases.</li>
<li>Childhood factors continue to exert their influence well into
adulthood.</li>
<li>Kittleson et al. (2006): doctors who came from low SES backgrounds
were more than twice as likely to develop coronary heart disease (CHD)
before the age of 50 years than those from more affluent backgrounds,
even after adjusting for other risk factors including body mass index,
cholesterol level, amount of exercise, smoking, hypertension, diabetes
mellitus and parental history of heart disease.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Different Health Behaviours</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><p>Ill health and premature mortality in the lower socio-economic
groups is engaging in more health-damaging and less health-promoting
behaviours than those in the higher socio-economic groups.</p></li>
<li><p>The incidence of smoking, drinking, a less healthy diet and less
exercise is more prevalent in those of lower SES than higher
SES.</p></li>
<li><p>In Australia the most socially disadvantaged people are twice as
likely to smoke, eat a less healthy diet and do less exercise than those
who are better off.</p></li>
<li><p>A smaller proportion of children from families experiencing
financial stress had an adequate fruit and vegetable intake, as compared
to those from families without financial stress.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there is consistent evidence that while differences in
health-related behaviours account for some of the socio-economic
differences in health, they do not provide the full story.</p></li>
<li><p>People in lower SES groups were nearly three times more likely to
die over a period of 10 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Two thirds of this variance was accounted for by diet, smoking
and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>The other third was directly attributable to their SES.</p></li>
<li><p>Low SES appears to exert an influence on health both by its
association with less healthy eating habits and behaviours, and also
independently of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham (1994):</p>
<ul>
<li>Rather than a lack of knowledge about health behaviours, health
compromising behaviours may be a deliberate choice based on a
calculation of the costs and benefits of such behaviours.</li>
<li>For Example: working-class women smokers were well aware of the
adverse health consequences</li>
<li>They continued to do so as it helped them cope with the day-to-day
stresses of running a family with low economic resources.</li>
<li>In another study priority in food choice was often based on taste,
being filling, hot and appetite satisfying.</li>
<li>Their meals acted as a form of emotional support that could improve
other aspects of family wellbeing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Social context in which we live:</p>
<ul>
<li>Healthy food can be more difficult to access and afford than
unhealthy food.</li>
<li>Researchers found that healthy foods had risen in cost more than
unhealthy foods, relative to inflation.</li>
<li>Milk, bread, eggs and some meats had risen in cost to 20% above
inflation, while soft drinks, edible fats and oils, and cakes and
biscuits had dropped below inflation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<summary>
<strong>Access to Health Care</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><p>Access to healthcare can differ according to personal
characteristics and the healthcare system the individual is interacting
with.</p></li>
<li><p>Access to the US health care system is predicated on substantial
financial barriers to healthcare following a myocardial infarction
(MI).</p>
<ul>
<li>18% of their large sample (who had health insurance) reported that
financial barriers prevented access to appropriate care:</li>
<li>13% reported financial barriers to accessing appropriate
medication.</li>
<li>Poor access to healthcare or medication was associated with poorer
quality of life, more hospitalisation and higher levels of angina.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The universal health insurance system (Medicare) in Australia was
introduced in 1984, funded from general taxation.</p></li>
<li><p>Free access to hospital services is available to all residents,
and 85% of the fee for out-of-hospital services (including optometry) is
covered.</p></li>
<li><p>Lower SES groups in Australia access Medicare more frequently
than those in the higher SES groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite most people being covered by Medicare in Australia,
access to healthcare services is still mediated by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Availability of services (especially in rural and outer urban
areas),</li>
<li>The cost of health-care services (especially services to which
patients are referred from primary care),</li>
<li>Waiting times (especially allied health services),</li>
<li>Outpatient medical specialist services, and</li>
<li>Elective procedures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>People from lower socio-economic groups may also be less likely
to seek appropriate medical care, even when it is available.</p></li>
<li><p>While individuals from more lower SES areas are more likely to
visit a GP, they are less likely to have visited a specialist or seen a
dentist.</p></li>
<li><p>Females from more disadvantaged areas were also less likely to
report ever having had a Pap smear.</p></li>
<li><p>Socio-economic status also appears to influence treatment options
offered to, and considered by, patients.</p></li>
<li><p>Differences in the way in which GPs responded to patients with
anxiety or depression.</p></li>
<li><p>They were more likely to prescribe to, and less likely to refer
or offer non-pharmacological interventions for, unemployed
patients.</p></li>
<li><p>Australian patients from high SES groups were more likely to be
prescribed statins than people with the equivalent levels of cholesterol
from low-income groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Women from higher SES groups were more likely to have a breast
reconstruction after breast cancer surgery, as they were more likely to
afford the surgery.</p></li>
<li><p>A report on health inequalities in Scotland revealed considerable
differences between the rates of:</p>
<ul>
<li>hip replacements,</li>
<li>hernia repairs and</li>
<li>varicose vein surgery</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A greater prevalence of these surgeries was noted for the well
off than the lower SES population.</p></li>
<li><p>Lower SES individuals are more likely to require a coronary
artery bypass graft for CHD than those in the higher SES
groups.</p></li>
<li><p>The relative difference was not as great as the differences in
the prevalence of CHD between the groups.</p></li>
<li><p>While more people received surgery, the poorer population
remained relatively deprived of healthcare in comparison to those in the
higher SES groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus increased use of healthcare resources may not be sufficient
to counter the additional levels of poor health associated with low
SES.</p></li>
<li><p>Health inequities can be difficult to remedy.</p></li>
<li><p>The UK government established a high-priority program to reduce
health inequalities across England via social and health service
interventions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements in health service delivery in deprived areas,</li>
<li>Improving housing and reducing child poverty.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A 2007 report (Department of Health, 2007) identified an increase
in inequalities in life expectancy over this time.</p></li>
<li><p>There was also mixed evidence of the impact of this initiative on
cancer and heart disease rates in the UK.</p></li>
<li><p>Cancer rates over the social groups did lessen, but the
differences in rates of heart disease actually increased.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, the gap between the quality of primary care services
in middle-class and working-class areas increased.</p></li>
<li><p>Even in contexts where treatment may be available without
prescription, there may be inequalities in access.</p></li>
<li><p>In the USA nicotine replacement therapy (a central element of any
smoking cessation program), was less available and more expensive in
pharmacies in the poorer suburbs of New York than the more affluent
ones. Cigarettes were equally accessible throughout the city.</p></li>
</ul>

<summary>
<strong>Environmental Factors</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>People in lower socio-economic groups are exposed to more
health-damaging environments such as building sites, and have more
accidents than those in the higher socio-economic groups.</li>
<li>In New South Wales, the highest burden of premature deaths is due to
accidents, injury and poisoning in the bottom two quintiles of
socio-economic status.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Housing</strong> - People from lower socio-economic groups
may experience home conditions of low-quality housing, and higher levels
of air pollution than those in higher socio-economic groups. - First
Nations people experience poor housing, overcrowding and poor water
quality more frequently than non-indigenous Australians. - Low SES
groups are likely to live closer to main roads carrying high levels of
traffic, airports, polluting industry, rubbish dumps and power stations.
- Negative impacts on children as a consequence of their physical status
and their chronic exposure to such pollutants. - Adults and children
living in poor housing are more likely to suffer from poor respiratory
health and asthma. - Excessive exposure to adverse environments, poor
health behaviours and health status may interact in a multiplicative
risk to health.</p>
<p><strong>Social and Psychological Pathways</strong> - Distance from
exercise facilities, poor traffic safety or poor environmental
conditions may reduce incidence and quality of exercise for children and
adults. - A secondary pathway may be a direct or indirect consequence of
poor living conditions. - A direct pathway may be via poor hygiene. -
The overcrowding associated with poor housing is associated with high
levels of stress hormones and, in animals, accelerated development of
atheroma and CHD.</p>
<strong>Other Affects</strong> - Householders who rent were
significantly more likely to report poor or only fair health status, in
comparison to home-owners. - Renters also reported a higher number of
serious health conditions than home owners. - In Britain, premature
mortality rates are about 25% higher among tenants than owner-occupiers.
- Tenants also report higher rates of long-term illness than
owner-occupiers. - After adjusting for age, male renters were 1.5 times
more at risk of developing CHD than male owner-occupiers, and women
renters were over twice as likely to develop CHD as their owner-occupier
counterparts. - There are a number of explanations for these
differentials: - Renters may experience poor ventilation, dampness,
overcrowding and so on. - Renters earn less than people who own their
house. - Rented occupation may be further away from amenities, making
access to leisure facilities or good-quality shops more difficult. - The
psychological consequences of living in differing types of accommodation
may directly impact on health. - A range of mental and physical health
measures were significantly associated with housing tenure even after
controlling for the quality of housing, and the age, sex, income and
self-esteem of their occupiers. - The type of tenure itself is directly
associated with health. - The degree of control we have over our living
environment may influence mood, levels of stress and perceived control
over a wider set of health behaviours. - Negative social comparisons
appear to have a direct effect on self-esteem, anxiety and depression,
which may in turn influence health.

<li>Stressors more prevalent in lower SES groups include issues during
childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and older age.</li>
<li>Wilkinson (1990) linked income disparity and life expectancy,
emphasizing the impact of income distribution.</li>
<li>Longitudinal studies in Glasgow showed increased income disparities
associated with higher mortality rates in lower-income groups.</li>
<li>Wilkinson’s ‘hierarchy-health hypothesis’ suggests that awareness of
one’s position in the social hierarchy affects health.</li>
<li>Subjective SES is a better health predictor than measured SES
(Singh-Manoux, Marmot, &amp; Adler, 2005).</li>
<li>Wider wealth disparities lead to lower social capital and cohesion,
impacting perceived safety and causing stress (Wilkinson &amp; Pickett,
2010).</li>
<li>Low social capital is associated with individual distrust,
dissatisfaction, and mental health issues (Taylor et al., 2011).</li>
<li>High community-level social capital is linked to lower coronary
events, especially for lower-income individuals (Scheffler et al.,
2008).</li>
<li>Social capital and SES independently influence health (Aida et al.,

<li>Involuntary job loss increases health risks, especially for 51-61
year olds.</li>
<li>Individuals with little savings or financial security face worse
health impacts due to unemployment.</li>
<li>The threat of unemployment can adversely influence health.</li>
<li>Combination of work stress and threat of redundancy significantly
increases self-reported poor health prevalence.</li>
<li>Social support mitigates the impact of unemployment on mental
health.</li>

<h5>Recognise the health impact of having a minority status in
society</h5>
<ul>
<li>Majority or minority status in the population is a discriminating
factor in society.</li>
<li>Language, skin colour, and cultural practices can identify minority
groups.</li>
<li>Some families from minority groups may have lived in a country for
generations but still remain identifiable.</li>
<li>Minority groups, such as Hispanic and African American populations
in the USA, often experience poorer health outcomes.</li>
<li>Similar health disparities exist between migrants to Australia and
those born in Australia.</li>
<li>For instance, Greek and Italian migrants to Australia have a three
times higher incidence of type 2 diabetes compared to the
Australian-born population.</li>
<li>The starkest health disparities are observed between Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander people and non-indigenous Australians.</li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Aboriginal health in Australia</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Life expectancy at birth is about 10 years less for Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander people compared to other Australians (ABS,
2015).</li>
<li>Higher infant mortality rates, unemployment rates, and lower weekly
income for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</li>
<li>Extensive inequalities between indigenous and non-indigenous
Australians, including housing circumstances and access to
education.</li>
<li>Overall disease burden significantly higher for indigenous
Australians, 2.7 times for fatal diseases and 2 times for non-fatal
conditions, compared to non-indigenous Australians.</li>
<li>Majority of this burden attributed to chronic diseases:
cardiovascular diseases, mental and substance use disorders, cancer,
chronic kidney disease, diabetes, etc.</li>
<li>Higher mortality rate among indigenous Australians for
cancer-related deaths compared to non-indigenous Australians (Cancer
Australia, 2017).</li>
<li>Indigenous people aged 18 years or older are twice as likely to
experience high levels of psychological distress compared to their
non-indigenous counterparts (Data from the 2004–2005 National Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey, ABS, 2006).</li>
<li>Limited evidence of improvement in these disparities over time from
2003 to 2011; modest improvements offset by slight worsening in some
areas.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Reasons for disparities</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Ethnicity encompasses various factors such as language, religion,
migration, culture, ancestry, and identity.</li>
<li>Significant variations in health outcomes exist between different
ethnic groups.</li>
<li>Variations in causes of death and disease rates among different
ethnic groups in Australia.</li>
<li>Migrants to Australia may have better health outcomes compared to
native-born Australians.</li>
<li>Migrants to Australia have lower cardiovascular mortality rates,
attributed to a “healthy migrant effect.”</li>
<li>This effect could be due to healthier lifestyle choices or a
selection effect where healthier individuals migrate.</li>
<li>A significant number of individuals in ethnic minorities are in low
socio-economic groups.</li>
<li>SES significantly influences health outcomes, both in the general
population and within ethnic minorities.</li>
<li>Studies indicate a reduction in health disparities after adjusting
for socio-economic factors.</li>
<li>SES influences health behaviours, longevity, and overall health
within ethnic minorities.</li>
<li>Health disparities attributed to differences in health-related
behaviours, stress levels, and access to healthcare.</li>
<li>Ethnicity plays a role in these disparities, influencing how
individuals approach health and healthcare.</li>
<li>General consensus that ethnicity impacts health outcomes.</li>
<li>Proposed explanations for these differences include health-related
behaviours, stress, and healthcare accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<summary>
<strong>Differential Health Behaviours</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Behavioural Hypothesis:</strong> Variations in health
outcomes attributed to differences in behaviour across ethnic
groups.</li>
<li><strong>Modifiable Behaviours in Indigenous Population:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Over one-third of diseases occurring at higher rates in the
Australian indigenous population are associated with modifiable
behaviours.</li>
<li>Modifiable behaviours include tobacco use, alcohol consumption, high
body mass, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, high blood plasma
glucose, and dietary factors (AIHW, 2016).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Specific Health Behaviour Disparities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Higher smoking rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
people and those born outside Australia.</li>
<li>Lower levels of exercise among indigenous groups compared to other
Australians (ABS, 2005; AIHW, 2002).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Physical Activity Disparities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data from the 2004–2005 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Health Survey (NATSIHS) showed that 75% of indigenous people
reported sedentary or low levels of physical activity, 1.5 times higher
than non-indigenous people.</li>
<li>Health behaviours influenced by social and cultural beliefs,
behavioural norms, and differences in access to facilities like gyms and
other socio-economic factors across ethnic groups.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Stress</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Health disadvantages in minority groups can be attributed to the
psychosocial impact of occupying minority status.</li>
<li>Ethnic minorities experience wider sources of stress due to
discrimination, racial harassment, and cultural demands.</li>
<li>Clark’s studies on African American women showed that experiencing
racism led to increased blood pressure and stronger emotional reactions
during stressful tasks.</li>
<li>Individuals subject to racism and responding negatively, such as
becoming angry, had higher blood pressure.</li>
<li>A study in Australia on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
supported the link between experiencing racism and worse mental health,
emphasizing the importance of reducing racism to improve mental
health.</li>
<li><strong>John Henryism</strong> suggests that successful individuals
from minority groups may experience higher stress due to the extra
effort needed to achieve success, potentially leading to higher blood
pressure.</li>
<li>Discrimination towards Puerto Ricans in the USA was linked to higher
levels of various diseases through pathways involving depression.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Access to Healthcare</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Ethnic minorities may face challenges in accessing healthcare and
receiving equitable treatments within the hospital system.</li>
<li>African Americans and Hispanics tend to receive lower quality of
care for various diseases in the USA.</li>
<li>Disparities exist even when clinical factors like disease severity
are considered.</li>
<li>Disparities in care are associated with higher mortality among
minorities.</li>
<li>Similar disparities in access to healthcare exist in Australia and
the UK for indigenous populations and ethnic minorities,
respectively.</li>
<li>Lower access to healthcare services and procedures in public
hospitals has been observed for indigenous and minority
populations.</li>
<li>Choice to access healthcare services is at the discretion of
potential patients, influenced by various factors such as language
barriers, cultural preferences, access to alternative medicine, and lack
of information.</li>
<li>Communities at higher risk of ill health tend to experience the
least access to preventive services, known as the ‘inverse prevention
law.’</li>
<li>Women from ethnic minorities may face barriers to cervical cancer
screening, including lack of awareness, cultural attitudes, language
barriers, and access to female doctors.</li>
<li>Differential use of healthcare resources by ethnic minorities
results from a complex interaction between available healthcare options
and individual choices related to accessing them.</li>

<div id="discuss-the-impact-of-gender-on-health" class="section level5">
<h5>Discuss the impact of gender on health</h5>
<ul>
<li>Women in most industrialized countries have a significantly greater
life expectancy compared to men (84.5 years for women and 80.4 years for
men).</li>
<li>Earlier onset of coronary heart disease (CHD) in men is a
significant contributor to the difference in life expectancy.</li>
<li>Men are three and a half times more likely than women to die from a
myocardial infarction (MI) between the ages of 25 and 64.</li>
<li>Despite the higher risk of CHD in men, women who survive to age 65
tend to live longer than men.</li>
<li>Men in Australia are more likely to die from accidents (3.5 times
more likely) compared to women.</li>
<li>In industrializing countries, differences in life expectancy between
men and women are smaller or even reversed.</li>
<li>Women may experience higher rates of premature illness and mortality
due to pregnancy-related health risks and inadequate health services in
these countries.</li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Biological Differences</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Biological differences between men and women may contribute to
variations in health and longevity.</li>
<li>Women tend to have greater resistance to infections throughout their
lifespan.</li>
<li>Initial theories suggested that high levels of oestrogen in women
might delay the onset of coronary heart disease (CHD) by reducing blood
clot tendency and maintaining low blood cholesterol levels.</li>
<li>However, research did not find a significant reduction in CHD risk
before menopause or an increase following it.</li>
<li>Testosterone, once believed to increase atheroma risk and MI risk,
is now viewed as protective against CHD due to its impact on blood
lipids (high testosterone associated with low HDL cholesterol).</li>
<li>Men generally demonstrate a greater physiological response to
stress, including higher stress hormone levels and increased blood
pressure.</li>
<li>However, recent evidence suggests that these differences may not be
solely biologically determined.</li>
<li>Blood pressure reactivity varies based on the type and perception of
stress rather than gender.</li>
<li>Psychological response and long-term exposure to different stresses
may play a more significant role in gender differences in stress
reactivity than biological factors.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Behavioural Differences</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Women generally consume less alcohol, smoke less, and engage in
healthier dietary habits compared to men.</li>
<li>Men are more likely to engage in risky health behaviours, such as
heavy alcohol consumption and smoking, and eat more meat.</li>
<li>Men tend to engage more in work or leisure related exercise compared
to women.</li>
<li>Men visit doctors less frequently than women and are less likely to
seek medical help when needed.</li>
<li>Women are statistically more likely than men to participate in
health screenings, such as bowel cancer screening.</li>
<li>Socially disadvantaged men are less likely to consult a doctor
compared to women, and high-earning men in the USA are even less likely
to do so.</li>
<li>Differences in health-related behaviours between men and women may
be socially influenced.</li>
<li>Traditional masculine beliefs contribute to men engaging in
health-risking behaviours and avoiding seeking help, aligning with
notions of masculinity and power.</li>
<li>Traditional masculine beliefs are strong predictors of risky health
behaviours like smoking and alcohol abuse.</li>
<li>Gender inequalities and power dynamics may negatively impact women’s
health, particularly in sexual behaviours.</li>
<li>Coerced sexual behaviour due to pressure from sexual partners can
lead to inconsistent condom use, increasing the risk of sexually
transmitted diseases.</li>
<li>Gender-based violence and restrictions imposed by partners can
affect women’s ability to make safer choices regarding sexual
health.</li>

<strong>Economic and Social Factors</strong>
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Socio-economic Gender Disparities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Workforce participation rate: Women 59.3%, Men 70.4%
(Australia).</li>
<li>Women are more represented in part-time jobs than men
(Australia).</li>
<li>Full-time average weekly earnings: Women earn 16.2% less than men
(Australia).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gender Disparities in the UK:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nearly 30% of women are economically inactive in the UK.</li>
<li>Women predominantly employed in clerical, personal, and retail
sectors with low-paid work in the UK.</li>
<li>About two-thirds of adults in the poorest households in the UK are
women.</li>
<li>Women make up 60% of adults in households dependent on income
support (indicator of low income).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Social Isolation and Networks:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Social isolation is more frequent among women than men.</li>
<li>Women are less likely to drive or have access to a car, making them
more vulnerable to social isolation.</li>
<li>Older women are more likely to be widowed and live alone.</li>
<li>Irregular social contact or dissatisfaction with social networks is
linked to subjective health and mortality.</li>
<li>Lack of regular contact with close relatives may impact women’s
longevity negatively.</li>
