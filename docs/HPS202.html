Erikson’s Theory of Conflict
</summary>
<p>In contrast to Freud’s theory, Erikson focused more on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the social impact of development rather than sexual,</li>
<li>rational development rather than selfish and irrational,</li>
<li>activity and the ability for people to adapt to, or overcome
damaging early experiences, and</li>

Limitations of Erikson’s theory
</summary>
While Erikson’s theory has garnered support for providing a broad
framework that covers the entire lifespan and emphasises the importance
of social interactions and how relationships shape personal development,
critics have suggested the theory is not well described, particularly in
relation to the exact mechanisms used for resolving conflicts.

<p></br></p>
<ul>
<li>Influenced by Erikson’s work…</li>
<li>Marcia (1980) determined that rather than a ‘sense’ or ‘attitude’
about oneself, personal identity was a self-structure, or “An internal,
self-constructed, dynamic organisation of drives. abilities, beliefs,
and individual history”.</li>
<li>He believed that the more well-developed this structure is, the more
an individual would have a greater idea about their uniqueness and
difference to others, and an understanding of their strengths and
weaknesses.</li>
<li>In contrast, those individuals who are less self-aware become
confused and rely on external evaluation from others.</li>
<li>Marcia proposed that identity is dynamic and could change over
time.</li>
<li>Decisions in life are not singular events but rather recurring
processes.</li>
<li>While potentially considered trivial, choices such as relationships,
sexual activity, substance use, education, career paths, leisure
activities, and political engagement all contribute to the formation of
individual identity.</li>
<li>Over time, these decisions and the underlying motivations coalesce
into a consistent framework. However, individuals may circumvent the
decision-making process by adhering to familial values, succumbing to
external pressures, or experiencing indecisiveness.</li>
<li>Marcia operationalised Erikson’s theory and proposed 4 types of
identity status:
<ul>
<li>identity achievement,</li>
<li>identity foreclosure,</li>
<li>identity moratorium, and</li>
<li>identity diffusion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each identity status involves the presence or absence of a crisis
and the presence or absence of a commitment to that identity.<br />
</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Identity in Adolescence according to Marcia
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The transition through adolescence toward adulthood it is common to
move from diffusion into moratorium (incorporating the exploration of
options).</li>
<li>This transition subsequently moves into identity achievement after
options have been explored.</li>
<li>Different aspects of an individual’s identity may be in different
phases.
<ul>
<li>For example, a young person may be committed to a vocation but may
be exploring their sexuality (we will explore this further in the topic:
Gender &amp; Sexuality).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ideally, young people in adolescence should be exposed to various
positive experiences and role models to support their journey and
positive identity development.</li>

<li><p><strong>Components of Self-Concept</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Perception</strong>: How we view our behaviors,
abilities, and unique characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Beliefs</strong>: Statements like “I am a good friend” or “I
am a kind person” contribute to our self-concept.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Examples of Self-Concept</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personality Traits</strong>: Identification as an extrovert
or introvert.</li>
<li><strong>Life Roles</strong>: Importance of roles such as parent,
sibling, friend, and partner.</li>
<li><strong>Hobbies and Passions</strong>: Interests that shape
identity, like sports enthusiasm or political/religious
affiliations.</li>
<li><strong>Social Contribution</strong>: Feelings about one’s impact on
society.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Importance of Self-Perception</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affects motivations, attitudes, and behaviors.</li>
<li>Influences feelings of competence and self-worth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Development of Self-Concept</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>More malleable during youth, as individuals explore self-discovery
and identity formation.</li>

Carl Rogers’ Theory of Self-Concept
</summary>
<p><strong>Three Components of Self-Concept:</strong> 1. <strong>Ideal
Self</strong>: - The person you aspire to be - Attributes or qualities
you’re working towards - Your vision of your perfect self 2.
<strong>Self-Image</strong>: - How you currently perceive yourself -
Influenced by physical characteristics, personality traits, and social
roles 3. <strong>Self-Esteem</strong>: - How much you like, accept, and
value yourself - Affected by others’ perceptions, self-comparisons, and
societal roles</p>
<p><strong>Congruence vs. Incongruence:</strong> -
<strong>Congruence</strong>: - Alignment between self-concept and
reality - Leads to a positive self-concept -
<strong>Incongruence</strong>: - Mismatch between self-image and ideal
self - Can negatively impact self-esteem</p>
<p><strong>Origins and Influences:</strong> - <strong>Childhood
Experiences</strong>: - Incongruence often rooted in childhood -
Conditional parental affection can lead to distorted self-perception -
<strong>Unconditional Love</strong>: - Fosters congruence - Helps
children accept themselves without distorting memories</p>
<strong>Impact:</strong> - Congruence or incongruence significantly
affects overall self-concept - Shapes how individuals perceive and
interact with their environment

How Self-Concept Develops
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Influences on Self-Concept Development</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Interaction and observation of others</li>
<li>Family members and close friends</li>
<li>Community members</li>
<li>Media representations</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact of Others’ Beliefs</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Teacher’s belief in high-performing students’ abilities can
positively affect their self-concept</li>
<li>No similar effect observed for lower-performing students</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Identification with Characters</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Stories and characters we relate to can shape our self-concept</li>
<li>Example: Female readers deeply engaged with traditional gender role
stories may develop a more feminist self-concept</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Media Influence</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Both mass media and social media play significant roles</li>
<li>Promotion of certain ideals can shape personal ideals</li>
<li>Frequency of exposure to these ideals affects self-identity and
self-perception</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Continuous Development</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Self-concept is not static but evolves through various experiences
and influences</li>
<li>Interactions with different sources contribute to ongoing
self-concept formation</li>

Other Self-Concept Theories
</summary>
<p><strong>Social Identity Theory (Henri Tajfel)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two essential parts of self-concept</strong>:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Personal identity:</strong> Unique traits and
characteristics</li>
<li><strong>Social identity:</strong> Based on membership in social
groups
<ul>
<li>Examples: sports teams, religions, political parties, social
class</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Impact of social identity</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Influences self-concept</li>
<li>Affects emotions and behaviours</li>
<li>Example: Feeling sad or acting out after a team loss</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Multidimensional Self-Concept Theory (Bruce A.
Bracken)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Six independent traits</strong>:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Academic:</strong> Success or failure in school</li>
<li><strong>Affect:</strong> Awareness of emotional states</li>
<li><strong>Competence:</strong> Ability to meet basic needs</li>
<li><strong>Family:</strong> Functioning within family unit</li>
<li><strong>Physical:</strong> Feelings about appearance, health, and
physical condition</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> Ability to interact with others</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Key aspect</strong>: Self-concept viewed as multidimensional
rather than unitary</li>

Contemporary Research on Adolescent Identity Development
</summary>
<p><strong>Intraindividual Processes and Differences</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dual Cycle Model</strong>
<ul>
<li>Focus on exploration and commitment in identity formation and
maintenance.</li>
<li>Identity processes generally mature systematically with limited
changes.</li>
<li>Longitudinal studies show stability in identity processes during
adolescence and young adulthood.</li>
<li>Research has shifted to examining intraindividual processes of
identity development over time.</li>
<li>Daily measures reveal associations between commitment-making,
exploration, and reconsideration.</li>
<li>Micro-level processes, including daily emotions and narrative
constructions, influence identity development.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dynamic System Approach</strong>
<ul>
<li>Daily fluctuations characterise identity micro-processes.</li>
<li>Developmental changes often occur during transitions or significant
life events.</li>
<li>Transitions marked by temporary increases in intra-individual
variability, followed by stabilisation.</li>
<li>Life events can shape identity by creating high points, low points,
or turning points.</li>
<li>Normative and non-normative transitions can prompt identity
reconsideration.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Identity and Psychosocial Adjustment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stable and strong identity commitments associated with better
psychosocial adjustment.</li>
<li>Weaker identity commitments linked to increased risk for various
issues (e.g., aggression, substance use, anxiety).</li>
<li>Positive identity processes lead to better adjustment outcomes.</li>
<li>Bidirectional relationships exist between identity development and
psychosocial adjustment.</li>
<li>Content of adolescents’ identities and cultural contexts are
important considerations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Identity and Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Social and personal identity are interconnected; relationships
crucial for identity development.</li>
<li>Supportive relationships provide a secure base for identity
exploration.</li>
<li>Narrative sharing with family and friends helps create coherent
identity narratives.</li>
<li>Autonomy support from parents and peers is important for identity
development.</li>
<li>Parental support and relationship quality positively influence
identity exploration and commitment.</li>
<li>Peer relationships play a significant role, though to a lesser
extent than parents.</li>
<li>Clearer identity may serve as a protective factor against negative
peer pressure.</li>
<li>Various relationships, including romantic partners and teachers,
influence identity development.</li>

Culture Definition
</summary>
<ul>
<li>No single definition fits all experiences.</li>
<li>UNESCO defines culture as encompassing spiritual, material,
intellectual, and emotional features of society.</li>
<li>ABS identifies culture as:
<ul>
<li>A shared approach to understanding existence.</li>
<li>Intangible paradigms in collective beliefs, stories, behaviours, and
practices.</li>
<li>Generationally shared and dynamic.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits for Minority Groups:</strong> - Positive cultural
identification leads to better academic and psychosocial outcomes and
lower anti-social behaviour risks.</p>
<p><strong>Identity:</strong> - Multidimensional concept, encompassing:
- Self-concept, self-esteem, self-efficacy. - Identity exploration and
commitment. - Social and narrative identity. - Situational, place, and
national identity.</p>
<p><strong>Formation and Connection:</strong> - Influenced by family,
social supports, formal learning environments, and online interactions.
- Positive identity and culture formation benefit from: - Caring home
environments and supportive relationships. - Opportunities to explore
identity. - Positive community perceptions and cultural engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and Protective Factors:</strong> - Risks: Lack of
exposure to cultural heritage, social support, and experiences of
oppression. - Protective factors: Stable home environment, safe identity
exploration, supportive peer relationships, and positive community
engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> - Various scales exist, often validated
with American cohorts. - Australian data on youth identity and culture
is limited, mostly parent-reported. - International frameworks highlight
identity and culture’s importance but lack policy implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Indicators:</strong> - Indicators should reflect
theory and a conceptual framework, encompassing: - Academic and youth
perspectives on identity and culture. - Multi-dimensional,
context-dependent nature. - Multiple identity formation sites. -
Gender-specific and age-related factors. - Cultural identity’s
protective role for minorities. - Consistent with the Convention on the
Rights of the Child. - Indicators should emphasise adult responsibility,
stakeholder engagement, outcome focus, and relevance for change.</p>
<p><strong>Institutional Sites for Change:</strong> - Education and
child protection systems are crucial for enhancing youth identity and
culture. - Actions include: - Education sectors providing positive
feedback and addressing discrimination. - Child protection services
facilitating family and cultural connections, holistic support, and
community engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Conceptual Framework:</strong> - <strong>Identity
markers:</strong> Labels and self-described identity aspects. -
<strong>Processes:</strong> Creation, transmission, and exhibition of
markers. - <strong>Environment:</strong> Context for processes, with key
influencers. - <strong>Outcomes:</strong> Self-worth and social
connectedness, including self-efficacy, self-esteem, aspirations,
access, participation, and perceptions of belonging and safety.</p>

The Genetic Material
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Understanding heredity begins at conception.
<ul>
<li><strong>Conception</strong> occurs when an ovum from a woman’s ovary
is fertilised by a man’s sperm.</li>
<li>This fertilised ovum travels to the uterus via the fallopian
tube.</li>
<li>Inherited traits are determined at conception.</li>
<li>After establishing what is inherited, we can explore how genes
influence our characteristics.</li>
<li>After conception, a biochemical reaction repels additional sperm
upon penetration of the ovum.</li>
<li>The sperm cell disintegrates within hours, releasing its genetic
material, the ovum also releases its genetic material.</li>
<li>A new cell nucleus forms around the genetic material from both the
sperm and ovum, creating a <strong>zygote</strong>.</li>
<li>A zygote is 1/20th the size of a pinhead but contains all the
material needed to develop into a complete human.</li>
<li>The human zygote’s nucleus contains <strong>46 chromosomes</strong>,
which consist of thousands of genes.</li>
<li>Chromosomes come in matching pairs, one from the mother’s ovum and
one from the father’s sperm.</li>
<li>Each parent contributes 23 chromosomes to their child.</li>
<li>Genes on each chromosome pair are located at corresponding
sites.</li>
<li>Genes are stretches of DNA, a double-helix molecule that resembles a
twisted ladder.</li>
<li>DNA can duplicate itself, enabling the zygote to develop into a
complex human being.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Growth of the Zygote and Production of Body Cells
</summary>
<ul>
<li>The zygote begins to replicate through mitosis while moving to the
uterus.
<ul>
<li>Initial divisions: 1 cell becomes 2, 2 become 4, 4 become 8, and so
on.</li>
<li>Before each division, the cell duplicates its 46 chromosomes.</li>
<li>Each new cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes, identical to the original
cell.</li>
<li>By birth, the child consists of billions of cells formed through
mitosis.</li>
<li>Mitosis creates new cells for growth and replaces damaged cells
throughout life.</li>
<li>Every new cell contains an exact copy of the 46 chromosomes
inherited at conception.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
The Germ (or Sex) Cells
</summary>
<ul>
<li>In addition to body cells, human beings have germ cells that solely
produce gametes (sperm in males and ova in females).
<ul>
<li>Gametes are produced through the process of meiosis:
<ul>
<li>Meiosis shares some of the characteristics of mitosis, but it
differs in ways that make the resulting cells able to join with gametes
to create a unique cell that will become a unique individual. Only the
germ cells reproduce in this way.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Production of Gametes Through Meiosis
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Male germ cells in the testes and female germ cells in the ovaries
produce sperm and ova through a process called meiosis.
<ul>
<li>The germ cell first duplicates its 46 chromosomes.</li>
<li>Then an event called crossing-over often takes place: adjacent
duplicated chromosomes cross and break at one or more points along their
length, exchanging segments of genetic material.</li>
<li>This transfer of genes during crossing-over creates new and unique
hereditary combinations.</li>
<li>Next, pairs of duplicated chromosomes (some of which have been
altered by crossing-over) segregate into two new cells, each of which
contains 46 chromosomes.</li>
<li>Finally, the new cells divide so that each of the resulting gametes
contains 23 single, or unpaired, chromosomes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Hereditary Uniqueness
</summary>
<ul>
<li>At conception, a sperm with 23 chromosomes unites with an ovum with
23 chromosomes, producing a zygote with a full set of 46 chromosomes.
<ul>
<li>Siblings with both the same parents have inherited 23 chromosomes
from each, however, the process of meiosis ensures genetic uniqueness
between siblings.</li>
<li>During meiosis, the segregation of chromosome pairs into new cells
is random.</li>
<li>Human germ cells have 23 chromosome pairs, allowing for over 8
million combinations per parent.</li>
<li>As a result of the crossing over process, a couple could
theoretically produce 64 trillion unique genetic combinations in their
offspring.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Multiple Births
</summary>
<ul>
<li>A zygote will split into separate but identical cells, which then
become two individuals.
<ul>
<li><strong>Monozygotic (identical) twins</strong> occur in about 1 of
every 250 births around the world, and develop from a single zygote and
have identical genes.</li>
<li>Monozygotic twins should show very similar developmental
progress.</li>
<li><strong>Dizygotic (fraternal) twins</strong> occur in approximately
1 of every 125 births, and occur when a mother releases two ova at the
same time and each is fertilised by a different sperm.</li>
<li><strong>Autosomes:</strong> The 22 pairs of human chromosomes that
are identical in males and females.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Male or Female?
</summary>
<ul>
<li>22 of 23 pairs are similar in males and females (autosomes), with
the 23rd pair, the sex chromosomes, determining sex.
<ul>
<li>Males have one X and one Y chromosome, while females have two X
chromosomes.</li>
<li>Fathers determine the sex of their children, with sperm carrying
either an X or a Y chromosome, and ova always carrying an X
chromosome.</li>
<li>The child’s sex is determined by whether an X-bearing or a Y-bearing
sperm fertilises the ovum.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What do genes do?
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Produce amino acids, forming enzymes and proteins necessary for new
cells.
<ul>
<li>Regulate melanin production, affecting eye color.</li>
<li>Guide cell differentiation, determining cell roles (e.g., brain,
skin).</li>
<li>Are influenced by their biochemical environment during
development.</li>
<li>Regulatory genes control the timing and pace of development, turning
other genes on and off.</li>
<li>Environmental factors influence gene function, affecting traits like
height despite genetic potential.</li>
<li>Gene expression can be affected at multiple levels: nuclear
environment, cellular surroundings, and external environment.</li>
<li>Environmental effects can be experience-expectant (universal) or
experience-dependent (individual-specific).</li>
<li>Genes interact with the environment to produce proteins that
influence human characteristics, not just “code” for traits.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
How Are Genes Expressed?
</summary>
<ul>
<li>There are four main patterns of genetic expression:
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple dominant-recessive inheritance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gregor Mendel discovered patterns in inheritance by cross-breeding
peas, identifying dominant and recessive traits.</li>
<li>Dominant traits appear more often in offspring, while recessive
traits are less common.</li>
<li>In simple dominant-recessive inheritance, the dominant allele’s
trait is expressed over the recessive allele.</li>
<li>Example: Normal vision (dominant allele) vs. nearsightedness
(recessive allele).</li>
<li>Three possible genotypes for vision:
<ul>
<li>Homozygous normal vision (NN)</li>
<li>Homozygous nearsightedness (nn)</li>
<li>Heterozygous (Nn) with normal vision</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NN individuals pass only normal vision genes; nn individuals pass
nearsightedness genes.</li>
<li>Nn individuals have normal vision but can pass either normal vision
or nearsightedness genes to offspring.</li>
<li>Two heterozygous (Nn) parents can produce a nearsighted child.</li>
<li>Punnett Squares represent the possible combinations of parents’
alleles and their outcomes.</li>
<li>The normal-vision/nearsightedness trait is one example of many human
attributes determined by single gene pairs where one allele is
dominant.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Codominance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Codominance occurs when alternative gene forms produce a phenotype
that is a compromise between the two.</li>
<li>Blood type example: Alleles for blood types A and B are equally
expressive, resulting in AB blood type.</li>
<li>Another type of codominance is incomplete dominance, where one
allele is stronger but doesn’t fully mask the other’s effects.</li>
<li>Sickle-cell trait is an example of incomplete dominance.</li>
<li>About 8% of African Americans are heterozygous for the sickle-cell
trait, carrying one sickle-cell allele.</li>
<li>Carriers may have some red blood cells in a sickle shape, leading to
potential circulatory issues under stress.</li>
<li>Individuals with two recessive sickle-cell alleles develop
sickle-cell anemia.</li>
<li>Sickle-cell anemia results in severe blood disorder, poor oxygen
distribution, and can lead to early death from heart, kidney, or
respiratory issues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sex-linked inheritance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sex-linked characteristics are determined by genes on the sex
chromosomes.</li>
<li>Most sex-linked traits are produced by recessive genes on the X
chromosome.</li>
<li>Males (XY) are more likely to inherit these traits because they have
only one X chromosome.</li>
<li>Example: Red/green color blindness is caused by a recessive gene on
the X chromosome.</li>
<li>A male with this gene on his X chromosome will be color-blind, as
there is no corresponding gene on the Y chromosome.</li>
<li>Females (XX) are not color-blind unless both X chromosomes carry the
recessive gene.</li>
<li>More males are color-blind (8 in 100) compared to females (1 in
144).</li>
<li>Over 100 sex-linked characteristics exist, many of which are
disabling (e.g., hemophilia, muscular dystrophy, optic nerve
degeneration).</li>
<li>Males are more likely to suffer from these disorders due to the
recessive genes on the X chromosome.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Polygenic (or multiple-gene) inheritance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Polygenic traits are influenced by many pairs of alleles, such as
height, weight, intelligence, skin color, temperament, and cancer
susceptibility.</li>
<li>More genes contributing to a trait increase the number of possible
genotypes and phenotypes.</li>
<li>Polygenic traits show continuous variation, typically following a
normal bell-curve distribution.</li>
<li>Few individuals have extreme traits; most are in the middle of the
distribution.</li>
<li>Polygenic characteristics can involve complex inheritance patterns,
including co-dominance, incomplete dominance, or sex-linked
inheritance.</li>
<li>These traits are more complex than single-gene traits.</li>
<li>Most traits of interest to psychologists (e.g., intelligence,
personality, mental health) are influenced by many genes.</li>
<li>A simple formula (one gene = one trait) is insufficient for
understanding these traits.</li>
<li>The exact number of allele pairs influencing traits like height or
intelligence is unknown.</li>
<li>Genes interact with environmental influences to create individual
differences in important human attributes.</li>
<li>Many human characteristics are influenced by a single pair of genes
(alleles), one from each parent.</li>

<summary>
The Period of the Zygote
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Movement and Division:</strong>
<ul>
<li><p>The zygote moves down the fallopian tube towards the uterus,
dividing by mitosis into two cells.</p></li>
<li><p>These cells continue to divide, forming a blastocyst with 60 to
80 cells within 4 days.</p></li>
<li><p>The inner layer of the blastocyst becomes the embryo; the outer
layer forms protective tissues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implantation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6 to 10 days after conception, the blastocyst develops tendrils that
burrow into the uterine wall, initiating implantation.</li>
<li>This process involves the blastocyst attaching to and penetrating
the uterine wall within a 48-hour window, completing around 10 to 14
days after ovulation.</li>
<li>About half of fertilised ova fail to implant, and many that do may
be genetically abnormal or improperly situated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Development of Support Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After implantation, the blastocyst forms four support structures:
<ul>
<li><strong>Amnion:</strong> Watertight sac that cushions the embryo,
regulates temperature, and provides a weightless environment.</li>
<li><strong>Yolk Sac:</strong> Produces blood cells until the embryo can
produce its own.</li>
<li><strong>Chorion:</strong> Surrounds the amnion and becomes the
placenta’s lining.</li>
<li><strong>Allantois:</strong> Forms the umbilical cord.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Purpose of the Placenta:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The placenta, fed by maternal and embryonic blood vessels, has a
semi-permeable barrier allowing gases, salts, and nutrients to pass
through.</li>
<li>It delivers oxygen and nutrients to the embryo and removes carbon
dioxide and metabolic wastes via the umbilical cord.</li>
<li>The placenta is essential for sustaining the embryo through
metabolic transactions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<summary>
The Period of the Embryo
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong>
<ul>
<li><p>Lasts from implantation (around the 3rd week) through the 8th
week of pregnancy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early Development:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By the 3rd week, the embryonic disk differentiates into three cell
layers:
<ul>
<li><strong>Ectoderm:</strong> Becomes the nervous system, skin, and
hair.</li>
<li><strong>Mesoderm:</strong> Develops into muscles, bones, and the
circulatory system.</li>
<li><strong>Endoderm:</strong> Forms the digestive system, lungs,
urinary tract, pancreas, and liver.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The neural tube forms from the ectoderm and will become the brain
and spinal cord.</li>
<li>By the end of the 4th week, the heart is formed and begins to beat;
eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and limb buds appear.</li>
<li>The embryo is about 1/4 inch long and 10,000 times the size of the
original zygote.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>2nd Month Development:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The embryo grows approximately 1/30 inch per day and develops more
human features.</li>
<li>A primitive tail forms and later becomes the coccyx (tip of the
backbone).</li>
<li>By the 5th week, the eyes have corneas and lenses; by the 7th week,
ears are well-formed and a rudimentary skeleton appears.</li>
<li>Limbs develop from the body outward, with arms and legs forming in a
similar sequence.</li>
<li>The brain develops rapidly and directs the first muscular
contractions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sexual Development:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By the 7th and 8th weeks, the embryo shows sexual development with
the formation of the indifferent gonad.</li>
<li>In males, a gene on the Y chromosome causes the indifferent gonad to
develop into testes.</li>
<li>In females, the gonad develops into ovaries without additional
instructions.</li>
<li>The embryo’s circulatory system functions independently as the liver
and spleen start producing blood cells.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>End of 2nd Month:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The embryo is slightly more than an inch long and weighs less than
1/4 ounce.</li>
<li>Major structures are formed, and the embryo begins to look more
human.</li>

<summary>
The Period of the Fetus
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong>
<ul>
<li><p>Lasts from 8 weeks of pregnancy until birth, characterised by
rapid growth and refinement of organ systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Development stages do not align with trimesters; the fetus
becomes recognisable as such around 8 weeks post-conception, and early
stages of development (zygotic and embryonic) often occur before
pregnancy is recognised.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Third Month:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Organ systems formed earlier continue to grow and interconnect.</li>
<li>Fetus performs subtle movements (kicking, making fists) that are not
yet felt by the mother.</li>
<li>Digestive and excretory systems become functional, allowing
swallowing, digesting, and urinating.</li>
<li>Sexual differentiation occurs; male fetuses secrete testosterone,
leading to the development of the penis and scrotum, while female
genitalia form in the absence of testosterone.</li>
<li>By the end of the 3rd month, the fetus is about 3 inches long and
weighs less than an ounce.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Fourth to Sixth Months:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fetus grows rapidly; by 16 weeks, it is 8-10 inches long and weighs
about 6 ounces.</li>
<li>Increased complexity in movements (sucking, swallowing, breathing)
prepares the fetus for life outside the womb.</li>
<li>The fetus starts kicking strongly enough to be felt by the mother,
and its heartbeat can be heard with a stethoscope.</li>
<li>Nails harden, skin thickens, and hair appears. Vernix and lanugo
cover the fetus.</li>
<li>By the end of the 6th month, the fetus’s senses (visual and
auditory) are functional, with responses to sound and light.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Seventh through Ninth Months:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Final “finishing phase” of rapid organ system maturation.</li>
<li>By 22-28 weeks, fetuses reach the age of viability, showing more
organised heart rate and motor activity.</li>
<li>By the end of the 7th month, the fetus weighs about 4 pounds and is
16-17 inches long; by 8 months, it grows to 18 inches and gains another
1-2 pounds.</li>
<li>Fat deposits under the skin help insulate the newborn.</li>
<li>Fetal activity slows, and sleep increases by the 9th month; the
fetus assumes a head-down position for birth.</li>
<li>Uterine contractions prepare the mother for labor and delivery.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Any disease, drug, or environmental
agent that can harm a developing embryo or fetus.</li>
<li><strong>Principles</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Sensitive-period principle: Effects are worst when an organ or body
part is forming.</li>
<li>Individual-difference principle: Susceptibility varies based on
genetics and prenatal environment.</li>
<li>Multiple teratogens can cause the same defect; one teratogen can
cause various defects.</li>
<li>Longer or higher exposure increases harm (dosage principle).</li>
<li>Both parents’ exposures can affect the fetus.</li>
<li>Long-term effects depend on the postnatal environment.</li>
<li>Sleeper effects may not be apparent until later in life.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Diseases Suffered by the Pregnant Woman</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Rubella</strong>: Can cause blindness, deafness, and heart
defects, especially if contracted early in pregnancy.</li>
<li><strong>Toxoplasmosis</strong>: Caused by a parasite; can lead to
severe damage or miscarriage.</li>
<li><strong>Sexually Transmitted Diseases</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Syphilis</strong>: Harmful in later stages of pregnancy; can
cause serious defects or miscarriage.</li>
<li><strong>Genital Herpes</strong>: Can lead to severe disabilities or
death; cesarean delivery is often recommended.</li>
<li><strong>AIDS</strong>: Transmitted prenatally, during birth, or
through breastfeeding; antiviral drugs can reduce transmission and
improve outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Drugs</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Thalidomide</strong>: Caused severe birth defects when used
in the first two months of pregnancy, including limb abnormalities.</li>
<li><strong>Other Common Drugs</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Heavy use of aspirin and ibuprofen can lead to growth retardation
and complications.</li>
<li>Excessive caffeine linked to miscarriage and low birth weight.</li>
<li>Some prescription drugs, like antidepressants containing lithium,
can cause heart defects.</li>
<li><strong>Diethylstilbestrol (DES)</strong>: Used to prevent
miscarriages; linked to reproductive organ abnormalities and cancer in
later life.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Alcohol:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Affects fetal development directly and indirectly by impairing
placenta function.</li>
<li>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) includes microcephaly, heart
malformations, and growth delays.</li>
<li>FAS babies often have irritability, hyperactivity, and learning
disabilities.</li>
<li>Moderate drinking can cause Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE), such as
growth retardation and learning deficits.</li>
<li>No amount of alcohol is considered safe; risks include miscarriage
and developmental delays.</li>
<li>Drinking in any trimester can be harmful; affects both fetal and
male reproductive systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cigarette Smoking:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Linked to cleft lip/palate, abnormal lung function, hypertension,
miscarriage, and low birth weight.</li>
<li>Increases risks of ectopic pregnancy and sudden infant death
syndrome (SIDS).</li>
<li>Smoking impairs placenta function, affecting oxygen and nutrient
exchange.</li>
<li>Long-term effects include smaller size, respiratory infections, and
cognitive issues.</li>
<li>Smoking interacts with other drugs, exacerbating teratogenic
effects.</li>
<li>Strongly advised to avoid smoking during pregnancy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Illicit Drugs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Widespread exposure, including marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, leads
to various defects.</li>
<li>Marijuana use affects emotional regulation and can cause
developmental issues like poor academic performance.</li>
<li>Heroin and methadone use are linked to higher miscarriage rates,
preterm delivery, and withdrawal symptoms in newborns.</li>
<li>Cocaine use constricts blood vessels, leading to prematurity and
developmental deficits such as lower IQ and language issues.</li>
<li>Prenatal cocaine exposure can also affect emotional bonding and
intellectual development.</li>
<li>General advice is to avoid all drugs unless absolutely necessary and
approved by a physician.</li>

Environmental Hazards
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radiation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Teratogenic effects observed from the 1945 atomic blasts in Japan;
severe outcomes included high rates of infant mortality and mental
retardation in survivors.</li>
<li>The exact radiation threshold for harm is unclear, but potential
long-term complications are a concern.</li>
<li>Pregnant women are advised to avoid non-essential X-rays, especially
of the pelvis and abdomen.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chemicals and Pollutants:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pregnant women may encounter toxic substances like dyes, additives,
and pesticides, some of which are teratogenic in animals.</li>
<li>Exposure to pollutants such as lead, zinc, and mercury can impair
health and cause physical and mental developmental issues in embryos and
fetuses.</li>
<li>The highest damage occurs with exposure during both pregnancy and
breastfeeding.</li>
<li>Environmental toxins can also affect the reproductive health of
fathers, leading to increased risks of miscarriage and genetic defects
in children.</li>
<li>Both parents should limit exposure to known teratogens to reduce
risks to their offspring.</li>

Characteristics of the Pregnant Woman
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nutrition:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Historical advice recommended minimal weight gain; current
guidelines suggest a gain of 25-35 pounds with a high-protein,
high-calorie diet.</li>
<li>Severe malnutrition during pregnancy can lead to small, underweight
babies and increased risk of cognitive deficits.</li>
<li>Malnutrition impacts vary by trimester: early malnutrition can
disrupt spinal cord formation and induce miscarriages, while later
malnutrition may result in low-birth-weight babies with small
heads.</li>
<li>Dietary supplements and responsive caregiving can mitigate long-term
effects of prenatal malnutrition.</li>
<li>Adequate intake of vitamins and minerals is crucial: magnesium and
zinc improve placenta function, and folic acid helps prevent neural tube
defects like Down syndrome and spina bifida.</li>
<li>Recommended daily allowance of folic acid is 0.4 to 1.0 milligrams,
especially critical during early pregnancy. However, excessive intake,
particularly of vitamin A, should be avoided.</li>

The Pregnant Woman’s Emotional Well-Being
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact of Stress on Fetus:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Emotional arousal in pregnant women leads to hormone secretion
(e.g., adrenaline) that can affect fetal motor activity and heart
rate.</li>
<li>Temporary stress (e.g., a fall or argument) generally has minimal
impact, but prolonged severe stress is linked to issues like stunted
growth, premature delivery, low birth weight, and birth
complications.</li>
<li>High maternal stress is associated with increased fetal motor
activity and irregularities in infant behavior such as irritability and
difficulty with feeding and sleeping.</li>
<li>Studies show infants of mothers with high cortisol levels (stress
hormone) tend to be more irritable and have difficult temperaments.</li>
<li>Long-term effects of prenatal stress include an increased risk of
ADHD, externalising behaviors, and anxiety, especially when stress
occurs between weeks 12 and 22 of gestation.</li>
<li>Stress may impair fetal growth by diverting blood flow away from the
fetus, weakening the immune system, and leading to poor maternal health
behaviors (e.g., poor diet, smoking, alcohol use).</li>
<li>Emotional stress can affect maternal caregiving, potentially
perpetuating infant behavioral issues.</li>
<li>Not all stressed mothers experience complications. Effective stress
management and social support play crucial roles in mitigating negative
outcomes.</li>
<li>Counseling and support for stressed pregnant women can improve birth
outcomes, such as higher birth weights.</li>
<li>Moderate maternal stress may be beneficial for fetal development,
promoting neurological integration and developmental progress, as stress
hormones can aid in organ maturation.</li>

The Pregnant Woman’s Age
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimal Age for Childbearing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ideal age for pregnancy is between 16 and 35 years.</li>
<li>Risks for fetal and neonatal death increase significantly for
mothers aged 15 or younger.</li>
<li>Teen mothers (under 16) face higher chances of birth complications,
premature delivery, and low-birth-weight babies compared to mothers in
their 20s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges for Younger Mothers:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Younger mothers often come from economically disadvantaged
backgrounds, leading to poor nutrition, high stress, and limited access
to prenatal care.</li>
<li>Good prenatal care and medical supervision can mitigate these
risks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Risks for Older Mothers:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Women over 35 face higher risks of miscarriage and pregnancy
complications due to increased likelihood of chromosomal
abnormalities.</li>
<li>Older mothers may experience more complications during pregnancy and
delivery, though many have normal pregnancies and healthy babies,
especially if they are healthy and well-nourished.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<summary>
Prevention of Birth Defects
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perception vs. Reality:</strong> Although concerns about
birth defects and potential hazards are common, the majority of embryos
do not encounter significant issues and many that do are either not
carried to term or have minor, correctable problems.</li>
<li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Over 95% of newborns are perfectly
normal, with the remaining 5% risk having congenital issues that are
temporary or easily correctable.</li>
<li><strong>Prevention Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Parents can reduce the risk of birth defects by following
recommended guidelines.</li>
<li>Every pregnancy is unique, and efforts to ensure a healthy pregnancy
are valuable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Encouragement:</strong> Despite potential hazards,
significant efforts to ensure a healthy prenatal environment can greatly
improve the chances of a normal, healthy baby.</li>

Brain Development
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Brain Growth:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The brain grows rapidly in early life, reaching 75% of adult weight
by age 2.</li>
<li>Significant brain growth occurs in the last 3 prenatal months and
the first 2 years post-birth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Neural Development and Plasticity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The brain consists of over a trillion specialised cells (neurons)
connected by synapses.</li>
<li>Most neurons are formed by the end of the second trimester, but new
neurons continue to form in the hippocampus throughout life.</li>
<li>Brain growth spurt is driven by the development of glial cells,
which support and insulate neurons with myelin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Neural Development:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Neurons differentiate and specialise based on their location.</li>
<li>Synaptogenesis occurs rapidly, leading to an initial excess of
neurons and connections, with unused ones being pruned.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Role of Experience:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Early experience significantly influences brain development.</li>
<li>Studies show that sensory deprivation and enriched environments
affect neural development.</li>
<li>Higher socioeconomic status and maternal education are associated
with larger brain size in children.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Brain Differentiation and Growth:</strong>
<ul>
<li>At birth, subcortical brain centers are most developed; higher
cortical areas mature later.</li>
<li>Myelinisation enhances neural communication and continues into late
adolescence, affecting motor and cognitive functions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cerebral Lateralisation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The brain has two hemispheres with specialised functions: the left
for language and positive emotions, and the right for visual-spatial

<li>Lateralisation begins prenatally and becomes more pronounced with
age, influencing handedness and cognitive functions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Adolescent Brain Development:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Myelinisation of higher brain centers continues into adolescence,
improving attention spans and processing speed.</li>
<li>Brain plasticity persists beyond puberty, with ongoing

<details>
<summary>
Causes and Correlates of Physical Development
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biological Mechanisms</strong>
<ul>
<li>Physical development results from the interplay between nature and
nurture.</li>
<li>Genetic factors significantly influence growth patterns, such as
height and maturation rates.</li>
<li>Growth hormone (GH) is crucial for normal growth and is regulated by
the pituitary gland.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hormonal Influences</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hormones like testosterone and oestrogen play key roles in
adolescent growth spurts and sexual maturation.</li>
<li>GH and sex hormones are involved in the development of secondary
sexual characteristics.</li>
<li>The precise triggers for hormonal changes during adolescence are not
fully understood.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Environmental Influences</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nutrition</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adequate nutrition is essential for proper growth; malnutrition
leads to slow or stunted growth.</li>
<li>Short-term undernutrition may result in catch-up growth when the
diet improves.</li>
<li>Prolonged undernutrition, especially in early years, can cause
significant growth and developmental delays.</li>
<li>Common nutritional diseases include marasmus (insufficient protein
and calories) and kwashiorkor (insufficient protein with adequate
calories).</li>
<li>Overnutrition, particularly in Western societies, leads to obesity
and associated health risks like diabetes and heart disease.</li>
<li>Poor eating habits and lack of exercise contribute to obesity;
sedentary activities like excessive TV watching are linked to higher
obesity rates.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Illnesses</strong>
<ul>
<li>Common childhood illnesses have minimal long-term effects on growth
if the child is well-nourished.</li>
<li>Major illnesses in undernourished children can stunt growth due to
weakened immune systems and poor nutrient absorption.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emotional Stress and Lack of Affection</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nonorganic failure to thrive and deprivation dwarfism are growth
disorders linked to emotional neglect and lack of affection.</li>
<li>Nonorganic failure to thrive is characterized by poor growth despite
adequate nutrition and is often due to emotional neglect.</li>
<li>Deprivation dwarfism results from emotional deprivation and impacts
growth rates, despite proper nutrition.</li>
<li>Early intervention and improved caregiving can reverse these
conditions and support catch-up growth.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Infant Emotions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Infants display a range of emotions such as interest, joy, anger,
and fear from a young age.</li>
<li>Studies show that even very young babies have recognizable emotional
expressions, which become clearer with age.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Development of Emotional Expressions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Different emotions appear at different stages during the first two
years of life:
<ul>
<li><strong>At birth</strong>: Interest, distress, disgust, and
contentment.</li>
<li><strong>By 2 months</strong>: Social smiles and basic emotions like
anger, sadness, joy, surprise, and fear.</li>
<li><strong>Later in the 2nd year</strong>: Complex emotions such as
embarrassment, shame, guilt, envy, and pride emerge.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Self-Conscious Emotions</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embarrassment</strong>: Emerges with self-recognition in
mirrors or photos.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Evaluative Emotions</strong>: Require both
self-recognition and understanding of rules or standards (e.g., pride,
shame, guilt).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact of Parental Reactions</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pride and Shame</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Children’s expressions of pride or shame are influenced by parental
feedback.</li>
<li>Positive reinforcement leads to more pride and less shame.</li>
<li>Negative reinforcement can increase feelings of shame and decrease
pride.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Guilt vs. Shame</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Parental reactions affect whether a child feels guilt or shame in
response to misbehavior.</li>
<li>Critical reactions lead to shame.</li>
<li>Constructive criticism and encouragement lead to guilt and attempts
to make amends.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Developmental Aspects</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toddlers and young preschoolers often display self-evaluative
emotions in the presence of adults.</li>

Socialization of Emotions and Emotional Self-Regulation
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotional Display Rules</strong>
<ul>
<li>Societies have rules specifying when and how emotions should be
expressed.</li>
<li>Children learn these rules early, often modeled by their
parents.</li>
<li>Different cultures have different norms for acceptable emotional
expressions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Regulating Emotions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Early emotional regulation is managed by caregivers through soothing
techniques.</li>
<li>By six months, infants start to self-regulate using actions like
thumb sucking or turning away.</li>
<li>By the end of the first year, infants develop strategies like
rocking or moving away from distressing stimuli.</li>
<li>By 18-24 months, toddlers try to control people or objects that
upset them and distract themselves from disappointments.</li>
<li>Young children use distraction and reinterpretation to cope with
negative emotions.</li>
<li>Effective emotional regulation involves suppressing, maintaining, or
intensifying emotions as needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Parental Influence</strong>
<ul>
<li>Parents help children deal with emotions through distraction and
constructive discussion.</li>
<li>Children exposed to frequent negative emotions at home may struggle
with emotional regulation.</li>
<li>Parental responses to emotions can encourage children to feel
sympathy, guilt, or pride.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Acquiring Emotional Display Rules</strong>
<ul>
<li>By age three, children begin to disguise their true feelings.</li>
<li>Preschool children gradually improve in masking emotions and lying
convincingly.</li>
<li>School-aged children become more aware of and compliant with
emotional display rules.</li>
<li>Girls generally are better at complying with display rules due to
stronger social pressures.</li>
<li>Older adolescents who manage their emotions well have better social
outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cultural Variations</strong>
<ul>
<li>Communal cultures emphasize social harmony and compliance with
emotional display rules.</li>
<li>Compliance with display rules is motivated by a desire for social
harmony and acceptance.</li>
<li>Children who master emotional display rules are viewed as more

Emotions and Early Social Development
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Role of Emotions in Early Social Development</strong>
<ul>
<li>Emotions serve a communicative function affecting caregiver
behavior.</li>
<li>Infant emotions like distress, joy, and anger communicate needs and
desires to caregivers.</li>
<li>Emotional expressions help infants and caregivers understand each
other and foster social contact.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recognition and Interpretation of Emotions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Infants develop the ability to recognize and interpret others’
emotions.</li>
<li>Social referencing helps infants learn from others’ emotional
reactions.</li>
<li>Caregivers’ emotional displays contribute significantly to a child’s
understanding of their environment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emotional Competence and Social Competence</strong>
<ul>
<li>Emotional competence is crucial for achieving personal goals in
social interactions while maintaining positive relationships.</li>
<li>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) involves perceiving, facilitating,
understanding, and managing emotions.</li>
<li>Emotional competence has three components:
<ul>
<li><strong>Competent Emotional Expressivity</strong>: Frequent positive
emotions, infrequent negative emotions.</li>
<li><strong>Competent Emotional Knowledge</strong>: Correctly
identifying others’ feelings and their causes.</li>
<li><strong>Competent Emotional Regulation</strong>: Adjusting emotional
arousal to appropriate levels to achieve goals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each component is related to social competence, influencing how
children are perceived by teachers and peers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact of Emotional Competence</strong>
<ul>
<li>Children who express positive emotions and regulate their emotions
well are viewed more favorably.</li>
<li>High emotional understanding correlates with high social competence
and positive relationships.</li>
<li>Poor emotional regulation, especially of anger, can lead to
rejection by peers and adjustment problems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emotional Competence and Personality Development</strong>

Temperament and Development
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infant Temperament</strong>
<ul>
<li>Infants have distinct personalities, described in terms of
temperament.</li>
<li>Defined by individual differences in emotional, motor, and
attentional reactivity and self-regulation.</li>
<li>Thomas and Chess classified infants as “easy,” “difficult,” or “slow
to warm up.”</li>
<li>Six dimensions of temperament:
<ul>
<li>Fearful distress: wariness, distress, and withdrawal in new
situations.</li>
<li>Irritable distress: fussiness and distress when desires are
frustrated.</li>
<li>Positive affect: frequency of smiling, laughing, and willingness to
approach others.</li>
<li>Activity level: amount of gross motor activity.</li>
<li>Attention span/persistence: length of time focusing on objects or
events.</li>
<li>Rhythmicity: regularity of bodily functions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hereditary and Environmental Influences</strong>
<ul>
<li>Temperament has a biological foundation and is genetically
influenced.</li>
<li>Identical twins show more similarity in temperament than fraternal
twins.</li>
<li>Home environment influences positive aspects of temperament, while
nonshared environments shape negative aspects.</li>
<li>Parenting styles and early behavioral differences impact
temperament.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cultural Influences</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cultural values shape the desirability of certain temperamental
traits.</li>
<li>Shyness is viewed negatively in the U.S. but positively in some
Asian cultures.</li>
<li>Cultural changes can alter the social desirability of traits like
shyness over time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stability of Temperament</strong>
<ul>
<li>Components like activity level, irritability, sociability, and
fearfulness are moderately stable through infancy to adulthood.</li>
<li>Behavioral inhibition (withdrawal from unfamiliar people or
situations) is a stable attribute with biological roots.</li>
<li>Environmental factors, such as parenting styles, can influence the
stability of inhibition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Impact</strong>

these differences and their impact on later development.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assessing Attachment Security</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strange Situation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Developed by Mary Ainsworth.</li>
<li>Involves eight episodes simulating caregiver-infant interactions,
separations, and reunions.</li>
<li>Measures infant’s exploratory activities, reactions to strangers,
separations, and behaviors during reunions.</li>
<li>Classifications:
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure attachment</strong> (65%): Infants explore, greet
mother warmly, seek contact if distressed, outgoing with strangers when
mother is present.</li>
<li><strong>Resistant attachment</strong> (10%): Infants stay close to
mother, distressed by separation, ambivalent on reunion, wary of
strangers.</li>
<li><strong>Avoidant attachment</strong> (20%): Infants show little
distress on separation, ignore mother on reunion, sociable or avoidant
with strangers.</li>
<li><strong>Disorganized/disoriented attachment</strong> (5%): Infants
exhibit confused behavior, act dazed, may approach and avoid mother
simultaneously.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Attachment Q-set (AQS)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Used for children aged 1-5.</li>
<li>Observer sorts 90 descriptors of attachment-related behaviors.</li>
<li>Provides a profile of attachment security.</li>
<li>Versatile for older preschool children in natural environments.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Cultural Variations in Attachment
Classifications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attachment classifications differ across cultures reflecting
child-rearing practices.</li>
<li>Example: Northern German parents encourage independence, leading to
more avoidant behaviors.</li>
<li>Example: Japanese mothers’ close contact and focus on amae leads to
behaviors classified as insecure in the Strange Situation but valued in
their culture.</li>
<li>Western researchers often view attachment security as culturally
universal but recognize variations in caregiving patterns and their
outcomes.</li>
<li>Importance of understanding secure attachment may vary, reflecting
cultural values and practices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Father’s Role in Attachment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early research focused mainly on mothers.</li>
<li>Increasing focus on fathers and whole families as attachment
figures.</li>
<li>Exploration of fathers’ contributions to infants’ social and
emotional development.</li>

Fathers as Caregivers
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Historical Context</strong>:
<ul>
<li><p>Fathers were once seen as minor contributors to child
development.</p></li>
<li><p>They spend less time interacting with babies compared to
mothers.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite this, fathers are fascinated with their newborns and
increase involvement over the first year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attachment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infants often form secure attachments to fathers if the father has a
positive attitude, spends time with them, and is a sensitive
caregiver.</li>
<li>Fathers tend to engage in playful physical stimulation and unusual
games.</li>
<li>Infants prefer mothers when upset but often prefer fathers as
playmates.</li>
<li>Fathers can become skillful caregivers and serve as a secure base
for exploration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Emotional Security and Social Competence</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Children securely attached to both parents are less anxious,
socially withdrawn, and adjust better to school.</li>
<li>Secure attachment with fathers leads to better emotional
self-regulation, social competencies, and lower levels of problem
behaviors and delinquency.</li>
<li>Benefits of secure attachment with fathers are evident even if the
father does not reside in the home.</li>
<li>Secure attachment with both parents contributes the most to a
child’s development.</li>

Factors That Influence Attachment Security
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Influencing Factors</strong>:
<ul>
<li><p>Quality of caregiving</p></li>
<li><p>Emotional climate of the home</p></li>
<li><p>Health conditions and temperaments of infants</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quality of Caregiving</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure attachments: Sensitive, responsive caregiving from the
beginning.</li>
<li>Resistant attachments: Inconsistent caregiving.</li>
<li>Avoidant attachments: Impatient, unresponsive, or overzealous
caregiving.</li>
<li>Disorganized/disoriented attachments: History of neglect or
abuse.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>At-Risk Insensitive Caregivers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clinically depressed parents</li>
<li>Parents who were neglected or abused as children</li>
<li>Parents of unwanted pregnancies</li>
<li>Caregivers with health, legal, or financial problems</li>
<li>Unhappily married parents</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Intervention and Assistance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infant mental health (IMH) interventions</li>
<li>Programs improving caregiver sensitivity and responsiveness</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Infant Characteristics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jerome Kagan’s temperament hypothesis: Attachment behaviors reflect
infant temperament.</li>
<li>Evidence against the extreme temperament hypothesis: Secure and
insecure attachments can vary between caregivers.</li>
<li>Studies show environmental influences and caregiving are more
predictive of attachment quality than genetics or temperament
alone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Combined Influences of Caregiving and
Temperament</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality of caregiving predicts secure vs. insecure attachments.</li>
<li>Infant temperament predicts type of insecurity.</li>
<li>Goodness-of-fit model: Secure attachments from a good fit between
caregiving and infant temperament.</li>

Types of Play and Their Functions
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Play is essential for healthy development and is emphasized in
educational curricula and various child-focused professions.
<ul>
<li>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the right to
play.</li>
<li>Parten’s categories reflect the complexity of social interactions in
play but do not capture all variations.</li>
<li>Parten’s (1932) observational study identified <strong>six types of
play</strong> in preschool children:
<ul>
<li><strong>Cooperative play:</strong> Most complex, involves formal
games, social pretend play, and constructive play. Rare before age
3.</li>
<li><strong>Associative play:</strong> Children talk and share materials
without taking different roles or completing joint projects. Most common
among 4-year-olds.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel play:</strong> Children play beside others using
the same toys but do not interact. Most common among 2-year-olds.</li>
<li><strong>Onlooker behavior:</strong> Watching others play without
joining in.</li>
<li><strong>Unoccupied play:</strong> Watching whatever interests them
without playing.</li>
<li><strong>Solitary play:</strong> Playing alone in a way different
from those around them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subsequent research supports these categories but offers different
conclusions.</li>
<li>Modern research has expanded on Parten’s work by focusing on types
of play and their developmental contributions:
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical play:</strong> Enjoyable whole or part body
movements, common in early years.</li>
<li><strong>Rough and tumble play:</strong> Play fighting and chasing,
common during school years.</li>
<li><strong>Play with objects:</strong> Begins around 5 months,
progresses from exploration to functional use and pretend play.</li>
<li><strong>Pretend play:</strong> Involving drawing others into pretend
activities and using objects symbolically. Develops in several
sequences:
<ul>
<li><strong>Decentration:</strong> where the child draws others into
pretend activities, which can include parents but also objects such as
stuffed toys and dolls,</li>
<li><strong>Decontextualisation:</strong> where the child can use one
object to represent another, such as using a stick as a sword, and</li>
<li><strong>Integration:</strong> where individual acts of pretend play
becoming ‘joined up’ into patterns of connected activities, such as
making a doll run, climb up a tower of blocks and jump off.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sociodramatic play:</strong> Pretend play with others,
increases in preschool and school years.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Functions of play:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classical theories:</strong> Play as exercise for future
skills, adaptive for survival.</li>
<li><strong>Piagetian theory:</strong> Social interactions in play drive
cognitive development.</li>
<li><strong>Vygotskian theory:</strong> Play builds mental structures
using cultural tools (e.g., language, concepts).</li>
<li>Promotes social development and competence.</li>
<li>Benefits problem-solving, creativity, theory of mind, and
self-control.</li>
<li>Potential stress release function.</li>

Variations in parenting styles and practices
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>General Overview</strong>
<ul>
<li>Baumrind’s typology gives a general picture of parenting</li>
<li>Reflects observations of many parents, but individual and cultural
variations exist</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Individual Variations in Parenting Styles</strong>
<ul>
<li>Parents may display different parenting styles in different
situations (Eisenberg &amp; Valiente, 2002; Merz et al., 2016)</li>
<li>Influencing factors: duration of parenthood, birth order, family
changes (separation, divorce, remarriage), stress levels, child
temperament</li>
<li>Baumrind’s typology should apply to behaviors, not to parents as
individuals</li>
<li>Variations between parents of the same children can cause parental
conflict and confusion for children</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cultural Variations in Parenting Styles</strong>
<ul>
<li>Baumrind’s typology based on North American families</li>
<li>Cultural differences:
<ul>
<li>Asian-American parents show more authoritarian behaviors termed as
chiao shun (Chao, 1994, 2001)</li>
<li>Chinese parents balance authoritative and authoritarian styles
(Schwalb et al., 2004)</li>
<li>African-American and Hispanic parenting includes elements of
authoritarian styles with positive outcomes (Cabrera &amp; Garcia-Coll,
2004; Cabrera et al., 2017)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sorkhabi (2005) notes similar functions of parenting styles across
cultures, but more research needed</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Importance of Recognizing Variations</strong>
<ul>
<li>Baumrind’s styles reflect average patterns, not unique parent-child
interactions</li>
<li>Parenting styles do not solely determine child development</li>
<li>Other influences: siblings, family members, community</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example: S.K.I.P Program in New Zealand</strong>
<ul>
<li>Assists Sudanese parents to adopt positive parenting in a new
cultural context</li>
<li>Focuses on integrating traditional and New Zealand parenting
practices</li>
<li>Addresses challenges like changes in family power structures,
disciplinary practices, and intergenerational conflict</li>
<li>Community-based, culturally respectful workshops helped parents
learn positive discipline</li>
<li>Parents reported practical benefits and appreciation for the
program’s cultural sensitivity</li>

Theories of Social Development
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Piaget (1932)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Children’s relationships with adults are vertical (asymmetrical) and
involve power and dominance.</li>
<li>Children’s relationships with peers are horizontal (egalitarian) and
allow exploration of ideas and compromises.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sullivan (1953)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Friendships play a crucial role in children’s development.</li>
<li>Children move from being insensitive to peers to forming complex,
reciprocal relationships.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ethological theories</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Focus on the biological and evolutionary bases of behaviour.</li>
<li>Use naturalistic observation methods to study behaviour.</li>
<li>Behaviours are limited by biological constraints related to their
adaptive evolutionary function.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Social learning theories</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Children learn social behaviour through interactions with peers
(Bandura &amp; Walters, 1963).</li>
<li>Learning occurs directly (teaching) and indirectly
(observation).</li>
<li>Children act as agents of behavioural control, reinforcing or
punishing behaviours.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Research on children’s social learning</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Shows developmental progression in copying actions for similar
outcomes (Nielson, 2006).</li>
<li>Older children more likely to copy model’s actions when model is
sociable.</li>
<li>Children’s receptiveness to learning depends on model’s
communicative cues and child’s age.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cultural context</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Shapes children’s socialization and relationships.</li>
<li>Western cultures emphasize individualism; collectivist cultures
emphasize cooperation and group harmony.</li>
<li>Play and social behaviours vary by cultural context (e.g., Gaskins,
2000).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Group socialization theory (Judith Harris, 1998)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Children learn primarily from peer groups, not parents.</li>
<li>Interactions with peer culture explain socialization.</li>
<li>One‐on‐one interactions with adults are situation-specific and do
not generalize.</li>
<li>Non‐shared environmental factors encountered away from parents have
lasting effects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Criticism of group socialization theory</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Parents’ role is still significant in socialization (Vandell,
2000).</li>
<li>Even within the same family, children may receive different
parenting (non‐shared influence).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Siblings’ influence</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Older siblings teach socialization rules to younger siblings.</li>
<li>They can provide both negative (e.g., encouraging delinquency) and
positive (e.g., responsible role models) influences.</li>
</ul></li>

The Developmental Course of Peer Interaction
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infancy (birth to 1 year)</strong>
<ul>
<li><p>Early researchers noted significant social limitations in
infants.</p></li>
<li><p>Infants start to gaze at one another at 2 months.</p></li>
<li><p>By 6 months, infants show increased smiling, vocalizations, and
gaze towards other infants.</p></li>
<li><p>By 9 months, infants demonstrate a clear interest in
peers.</p></li>
<li><p>By the end of the first year, infants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intentionally display smiles, frowns, and gestures.</li>
<li>Attend carefully to play partners’ behaviors.</li>
<li>Respond contingently to interaction partners.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Interactions are rudimentary due to cognitive, motoric, and
linguistic limitations.</p></li>
<li><p>Sensitive interactions with adults pave the way for later peer
interaction skills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early childhood (2 to 5 years)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased locomotor, physical, cognitive, and language skills enable
new forms of social interaction.</li>
<li>Social interactions become more complex, reciprocal, and
sustained.</li>
<li>Toddlers show an elementary understanding of social exchange
rules.</li>
<li>Emergence of pretend play and prosocial behaviours (sharing,
helping) by age 3.</li>
<li>Preschoolers develop theory of mind and the ability to take
another’s perspective.</li>
<li>Conflicts and dominance hierarchies emerge, with dominant children
often winning conflicts.</li>
<li>Dominance hierarchies reduce aggression and allocate resources
within groups.</li>
<li>Social participation is largely controlled by parents and influenced
by the child’s social ecology.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Middle to late childhood (6 to 12 years)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing contact with peers, rising from 10% of interactions at
age 2 to 30% in middle childhood.</li>
<li>Peer groups become larger, more diverse, and less supervised.</li>
<li>Changes in social settings due to formal schooling and group
activities.</li>
<li>Shift from physical to verbal aggression and play involving
rules.</li>
<li>Social dominance hierarchies become more stable and agreed
upon.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Adolescence (12 to 18 years)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continued increase in time spent with peers as family relationships
are restructured.</li>
<li>Peer relationships become more intense and primary sources of social
support.</li>
<li>Two primary social structures: cliques and crowds.
<ul>
<li><strong>Cliques</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Close-knit groups of 3-9 friends held together by mutual acceptance
and common interests.</li>
<li>Initially same-sex, later build ties with opposite-sex cliques.</li>
<li>Dissolve into smaller groups as members pair off in dating
relationships.</li>
<li>Important for psychological wellbeing and adaptive coping
abilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Crowds</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Groups organized by reputation and shared stereotypes.</li>
<li>Examples include jocks, punks, brains, and druggies.</li>
<li>Less cohesive but bring together a wider set of adolescents.</li>
<li>Shift in perception from behaviours to dispositions and values.</li>
<li>Expose adolescents to a wider range of activities and social
functions.</li>

Peer status
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Adults, such as coaches or teachers, who are familiar with a group
of children generally have good insights into which children are well
liked or popular.
<ul>
<li>Even very young children understand which peers are popular or
unpopular.</li>
<li>Researchers use sociometric techniques to assess peer status by
asking children to nominate peers who fit specific criteria (e.g., name
three classmates you really like).</li>
<li>Sociometric nominations provide a picture of an individual’s status
within the group, with several strengths:
<ul>
<li>Peers have information about other children that adults cannot
access.</li>
<li>Peers have a broader range of experiences with other children in the
group.</li>
<li>Peer nominations and ratings represent a group perspective, not
reliant on a single source.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sociometric nominations allow researchers to classify children into
sociometric categories:
<ul>
<li><strong>Popular:</strong> high on “most liked” and low on “least
liked”; socially competent.</li>
<li><strong>Controversial:</strong> high on both “most liked” and “least
liked”; both liked and disliked.</li>
<li><strong>Neglected:</strong> low on both “liked most” and “liked
least”; friendless but not actively disliked.</li>
<li><strong>Average:</strong> some positive and some negative
evaluations.</li>
<li><strong>Rejected:</strong> low on “liked most” and high on “liked
least”; includes:
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggressive rejected:</strong> high levels of behaviour
problems, poor self-control, high aggression.</li>
<li><strong>Non-aggressive rejected:</strong> socially unskilled,
withdrawn, socially anxious.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rejected children feel lonelier and more isolated than popular
peers.</li>
<li>Popular and rejected categorizations are stable over time.</li>
<li>Recently, a new way of measuring popularity emerged:
<ul>
<li><strong>Sociometric popularity:</strong> how much students are liked
and not disliked by classmates.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived popularity:</strong> measure of social visibility
and perceived social dominance.</li>

Prosocial behaviour
</summary>
<ul>
<li>Prosocial behaviour refers to positive social actions that benefit
others.
<ul>
<li>Three strands of prosocial behaviour in early childhood:
<ul>
<li>Feeling for another (e.g., friendliness, empathic concern)</li>
<li>Working with another (e.g., helping with a task)</li>
<li>Ministering to another (e.g., nurturing, comforting)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Altruistic behaviours are solely aimed at supporting others without
expectation of reward.</li>
<li>Motivations for altruistic acts can include reciprocity, future
reward, social recognition, and relief of guilt.</li>
<li>Empathy is key in developing prosocial behaviour, consisting of:
<ul>
<li>Emotional empathy: experiencing others’ feelings</li>
<li>Behavioural empathy: assisting someone in distress</li>
<li>Cognitive empathy: understanding distressing situations and others’
emotional states</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Empathy develops early; babies and toddlers share feelings of those
around them.</li>
<li>Preschoolers can convert empathy into sympathy, leading to prosocial
actions.</li>
<li>Individual differences in empathy and sympathy are influenced by
genetics, environment, familiarity with peers, and temperament.</li>
<li>Parenting style and active instruction about kindness enhance
prosocial behaviours.</li>
<li>General helpfulness is a common prosocial behaviour in
preschoolers.</li>
<li>Motivations for helpfulness evolve from self-oriented to
other-oriented with age.</li>
<li>Prosocial behaviours increase with cognitive and social skill
development.</li>
<li>Factors affecting prosocial behaviour:
<ul>
<li>Gender (girls generally more prosocial)</li>
<li>Birth order (first-borns tend to be more prosocial)</li>
<li>Temperament (outgoing, emotionally expressive children are more
prosocial)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Environmental influences:
<ul>
<li>Parental opportunities and modelling</li>
<li>Warm authoritative parenting style encourages prosocial
behaviour</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Practical steps to maximize prosocial behaviour:
<ul>
<li>Verbal approval and encouragement for empathy, respect, and
helpfulness</li>
<li>Regular play opportunities supporting sharing, cooperation, and
helping</li>

Antisocial behaviour
</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition</strong>: Intentional negative actions harming
others, e.g., stealing, lying, physical assault, property damage, verbal
abuse, shaming, and undermining relationships.
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggression Types</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Instrumental aggression</strong>: Negative acts to secure
something, e.g., pushing to get in line or grabbing a toy.</li>
<li><strong>Hostile aggression</strong>: Aimed at harming others,
including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical aggression</strong>: Biting, hitting, kicking,
property destruction.</li>
<li><strong>Verbal aggression</strong>: Threats, teasing,
name-calling.</li>
<li><strong>Relational aggression</strong>: Undermining relationships
through rumors, insinuations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Development</strong>:
<ul>
<li>High levels of instrumental aggression in early preschool
years.</li>
<li>Decrease in instrumental aggression with age; increase in hostile
aggression.</li>
<li>Shift from physical to verbal aggression towards end of early
childhood.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Aggression Classification</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Reactive aggression</strong>: Defensive response due to
frustration or deprivation, characterized by loss of control and
disorganized lashing out.</li>
<li><strong>Proactive aggression</strong>: Premeditated acts of
meanness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sex Differences</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Boys display more physical aggression; girls show a slight
preference for verbal and relational aggression.</li>
<li>Sex differences may be due to social goals, learning theory, and
group dynamics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Harmful Effects</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Physical and verbal aggression cause immediate harm.</li>
<li>Relational aggression can be long-lasting and particularly damaging,
especially in bullying contexts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact on Perpetrators</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Aggressive behavior linked to future maladjustment, including both
externalizing and internalizing behaviors.</li>
<li>Boys exhibiting relational aggression face more severe penalties and
higher risk of maladjustment.</li>

<li><p>Persistent high levels may lead to conduct disorders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Temperamental Influences</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Children with difficult temperaments (e.g., emotional intensity,
poor self-regulation) more prone to aggression.</li>
<li>Ongoing parent-child conflicts can escalate aggression.</li>
<li>Longitudinal studies link early temperament issues to later
aggression.</li>
<li>Effective parenting can mitigate aggression in difficult
children.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Parenting Styles</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permissive, uninvolved, and authoritarian parenting linked to higher
aggression levels.</li>
<li>Authoritarian and permissive styles differentially impact boys’ and

<li>Authoritative parenting helps manage aggression and promotes
prosocial behavior.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Media Influences</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to violent media (TV, movies, video games) linked to
increased aggression.</li>
<li>Stronger effects on younger children due to less ability to

<h5>Demonstrate knowledge of risk and protective factors associated with
bullying in adolescence.</h5>
<ul>
<li>Bullying is a widespread phenomenon that can have devastating
consequences. Bullying may be more overt or implicit and occurs across
various settings, including face-to-face and online.</li>
<li>To provide context, the following definition of bullying, where it
can occur, and potential consequences was taken from the 2022 Australian
Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) Australia’s Children web
report.</li>
<li>Bullying can be physical, verbal or social.</li>
<li>Physical bullying includes actions that physically harm an
individual or their belongings, including stealing from them.</li>
<li>Verbal bullying includes spoken or written words intended to insult
or otherwise cause emotional pain to a person.</li>
<li>Social bullying includes actions intended to socially isolate
another person or otherwise attack their social standing, for example by
sharing personal information with others (Australian - Education
Authorities 2019; Kids Helpline 2019; Australian Human Rights Commission
2012).</li>
<li>Bullying-like behaviour includes behaviours related to bullying that
may not have occurred repeatedly. In some cases, this section includes
data on bullying-like behaviour.</li>
<li>Children can be exposed to bullying as victims, perpetrators,
bystanders or upstanders.</li>
<li>Upstanders, also known as supportive bystanders, attempt to help the
victim of bullying in some way by, for example, taking action to stop
the bullying or supporting the victim following an incident (Salmivalli
2014; Australian Education Authorities 2019; NSW Department of Education
2019).</li>
<li>Bullying can happen:
<ul>
<li>anywhere (for example, at school, home or in the neighbourhood)</li>
<li>in person or online</li>
<li>in an obvious or hidden manner (Australian Education Authorities
2019).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Physical, verbal and social bullying can all occur in person.</li>
<li>Cyberbullying, also referred to as online bullying, is a subset of
verbal and/or social bullying carried out through technology, such as
the internet and mobile devices.</li>

Key concepts of Piaget’s Theory
</summary>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Typical Development
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
An adult’s ability to formulate, execute and evaluate the outcome of a
plan is dependent on the outcomes of mastery experiences.
</li>
<li>
Mastery and a sense of competence are derived from the investigation of
our environment, directed problem solving, and persistence toward a
goal.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Schemes
</h4>
<ul>
<li>A scheme is “the structure or organisation of actions as they are
transferred or generalised by repetition in similar circumstances.”</li>
<li>The two primary schemes begin formation in infancy through:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Actions such as grasping and sucking,</li>
<li>Linking actions together (i.e., climbing into a high chair, or
crawling to the door to meet Dad).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Further schemes develop for people, objects, actions, and emotional
capacities (i.e., visual abilities to establish who is familiar and who
is not, or auditory abilities to express contentment or distress).</li>
<li>Schemes continue to develop throughout life, although they may be
difficult to explain to another.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Adaptation
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Adaptation contributes to organised thought which contributes to
structured thought</li>
<li>The context and diversity of experiences stimulate the formation of
new schemes.</li>
<li>Adaptation is the process of employing an existing scheme in an
experience, or altering a scheme through new experience:
<ul>
<li><strong>Assimilation:</strong> Refers to the interpretation of
existing schemes through existing schemes (i.e. assuming that someone is
a snob), and</li>
<li><strong>Accommodation:</strong> Refers to the alteration of existing
schemes based on new information (i.e. gathering more information about
a person to discover they are not a snob).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Egocentrism in
Childhood
</h4>
<ul>
<li>The beginning of each phase of development is marked by a limited
perspective, requiring <a href="."
title="A process allowing the person to approach situations from a more objective and analytical point of view, employing new, relevant behaviours.">decentering</a>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensorimotor:</strong> Inability to separate one’s own
actions from their effects on objects and people.</li>
<li><strong>Preoperational:</strong> Inability to separate one’s
perspective from that of another, such as the Facetime camera
example.</li>
<li><strong>Concrete to Formal Operational:</strong> Inability to
recognise that others may not share one’s own hypothetical system
(cooperation vs. competition).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Egocentrism in
Adolescence
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Decentring in adolescence requires participation in multiple roles
(family member, student, worker, friend) allowing a balance of their own
ideas with the expectations of others.</li>
<li>Addressing egocentrism in adolescence requires decentering around
our pluralistic society, and discrepancies between the goals and
aspirations of individuals. This process has two characteristics:
<ul>
<li><strong>Imaginary Audience:</strong> The tendency to assume we are
the centre of other’s attention, rather than understanding that others
have their own concerns and plans.
<ul>
<li>A judgemental and critical imaginary audience can lead to
development of anxiety and social alienation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Personal Fable:</strong> The belief that our experiences and
feelings are unique to us, or the “That will never happen to me.”
mindset.
<ul>
<li>An unchallenged personal fable may lead to a heightened sense of
self-importance.</li>

<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Preoperational Thought
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Children acquire five representational skills at this stage:
<ul>
<li>Imitation in the absence of the model,</li>
<li>Mental Images</li>
<li>Symbolic Drawing</li>
<li>Symbolic Play</li>
<li>Language</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This stage of development is characterised by
<strong>Representational (semiotic) thinking</strong>, where symbols and
signs begin to be interchanged to represent physical objects:
<ul>
<li>Using a matchstick as a symbol to represent a car.</li>
<li>Using a cardboard box as a symbol to represent a building.</li>
<li>The word dog as a sign referring to the animal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Children are unable to pretend prior to this stage, as they are
unable to let one object stand for another.</li>
<li>Children begin to recount events apart from the situation in which
they occurred (such as explaining what happened at school that
day).</li>
<li>They also begin to describe imaginary events or describe
relationships in both past and present tense, as well as what they are
like, and what they would like to change about them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Concrete Operational Thought
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The term concrete refers to problem solving in physical space
rather than generating hypotheses about philosophical or abstract
concepts.</p></li>
<li><p>A child going through this stage can perform mental and physical
operations, but not describe them</p></li>
<li><p>They can also perform mental operations around items with two
categories (coniferous and deciduous trees), as well as describing
features of these categories.</p></li>
<li><p>Deepen their understanding of the logic, order and predictability
of the physical world.</p></li>
<li><p>Beginning of application to logic and order to explain social
relations in areas of friendships, team play, self-evaluation and game
rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conservation:</strong> A child develops an understanding
in the change of form and its relation to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mass:</strong> same weight despite differing shapes between
the ball and pancake,</li>
<li><strong>Number:</strong> number of poker chips stacked, strewn
across a table, or lined up in a row, and</li>
<li><strong>Volume:</strong> Changing the shape of a clay ball to a
pancake of the same mass (differing shapes, same amount of clay).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>By the end of this stage, children are able to use the following
concepts to examine physical concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity:</strong> The same piece of clay is used to shape
the ball and the pancake,</li>
<li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> The malleable object can be shaped
and reshaped (ball to pancake to ball)</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> The ball is small and thick, while the
pancake is large and thin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Classification:</strong> Refers to the child’s ability to
identify the properties of categories, relate them to one another, and
use categorical information to solve problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grouping items together with similar characteristics (i.e. both
water and orange juice can be poured)</li>
<li>Birds
<ul>
<li>Ducks
<ul>
<li>Breed of duck</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Formal Operational Thought
</h4>
<ul>
<li>This stage of development is characterised by a gradual departure of
reliance on sensation based learning.</li>
<li>Move towards the realisation of logical bases for understanding and
analysing experiences.</li>
<li>A broadening of consciousness is evident through:
<ul>
<li>Greater introspection on thoughts,</li>
<li>Greater integration of information from various sources.</li>
<li>More focussed planning and control of behaviours with strategy and
goals offering guidance.</li>
<li>Considering several dimensions at once.</li>
<li>Mental separation/distinguish between reality and possibility
(identifying/analysing/changing job interests, balancing practicalities
(commute to different jobs, full/part time hours).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hypothetico-deductive reasoning</strong> best sums up the
development at this stage via the pendulum test:
<ul>
<li>Experiment to identify the sole cause of a swinging pendulum’s speed
of movement.</li>
<li>The variables to be examined are: the mass of the pendulum, the
starting height of the pendulum, the speed the pendulum is pushed at,
and the length of the string.</li>
<li>Concrete operational children have trouble at isolating the four
variables, and/or lose track of which are constant or variable.</li>
<li>Formal Operational children are capable of developing a matrix of
the variables to record results. </br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Six Characteristics of Formal
Operational Thought
</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Drawing on multiple variables to explain their behaviours as well as
that of others, mentally manipulating more than two types of variable at
the same time.</li>
<li>The changes (to things such as friendships) that may occur in the
future.</li>
<li>Ability to hypothesise about a logical sequence of possible events,
such as planning a career.</li>
<li>Anticipation of the consequences of one’s actions (i.e. dropping out
of school).</li>
<li>Detecting logical consistencies and inconsistencies in a statement
(i.e. All people are equal before the law vs the reality of rich

class="section level5">
<h5>Vygotsky’s Sociocultural Theory of Cognitive Development</h5>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Overview
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vygotsky proposed the concept of the <strong>zone of proximal
development</strong> to help explain the relationship of learning and
development.</li>
<li>Each child can be described as functioning at a certain mental age
and as having the potential to function at a more advanced mental
age.</li>
<li>The zone of proximal development is “the distance between the actual
developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the
level of potential development as determined through problem solving
under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers” (the
mid blue section).</li>
<li>A child’s abilities and potential can also be viewed as an abstract
and unusual shape rather than a circle, as well all develop in a
non-uniform fashion.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/HPS202/Week5/ZPD.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>We have all experienced a situation in which we were unable to solve
a task by ourselves, but with the assistance and advice of someone else
we were able to be successful.</li>
<li>Learning and development within the ZPD is informed by those around
us, and can take many forms:
<ul>
<li>The typical efforts of parents to help a child put together a jigsaw
puzzle by suggesting strategies (straight-edged pieces to make the
border, or sorting with a similar colour),</li>
<li>Children watch older children perform a task and they copy the
strategy,</li>
<li>Children ask their parents or teachers for help when they get stuck
in a task,</li>
<li>Teachers give children suggestions about how to organize a task or
how to use resources that will help them complete an assignment.</li>
<li>In these and many other instances, we recognize the variety of ways
whereby children expand the level of their independent problem-solving
capacities by drawing upon the expertise of others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vygotsky suggested that the level of functioning a child can reach
through the guidance of others reflects the functions that are in the
process of maturation.</li>
<li>The experiences and functions the child has been previously assisted
with are indicative of functions that have already matured.</li>
<li>In light of this, learning and cognitive development grows in the
direction of the intellectual characteristics of those who populate the
child’s world:
<ul>
<li>“Human learning presupposes a specific social nature and a process
by which children grow into the intellectual life of those around
them”.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Development Lags Behind Learning
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Development progresses when children are exposed to new ideas, and
engage with these new ideas.</li>
<li>Through everyday function, culture and social context guide progress
and direction of learning and development respectively.</li>
<li>Learning also prompts the reorganisation and internalisation of
existing developmental competences, which then become synthesized at a
new and higher intramental level.</li>
<li>Vygotsky used the term “zone of proximal development” to refer to a
range of potential performance.</li>
<li>When trying to assess a child’s developmental level, it is important
to understand:
<ul>
<li>What the child already knows and can already perform, and</li>
<li>The domains that are emerging as new fields of mastery.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adults, parents, teachers, and more advanced peers promote
development by engaging children in activities and problem-solving tasks
that draw children into the new directions along which their capacities
are maturing.</li>
<li>The interplay between two concurrent developmental levels (baseline
level of cognitive functioning, and potential level of functioning)
given appropriate instruction, support, and encouragement predict the
expansion of the child’s overall ZPD.</li>
<li>Both of these levels exist within the zone for each domain of
knowledge, and can be leveraged by education systems.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Cultural Historical Activity
Theory (CHAT)
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vygotsky’s cross-cultural focus was a departure from Piaget’s
regimented, Westernised stage based theory.</li>
<li>Comparisons of Piaget’s concrete and formal operational stages were
not immediately transferable to other cultures, because:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Children not performing well here were observed as capable in other
complex activities, and</li>
<li>Variations in schooling influenced a child’s approach to tasks,
including understanding of Piagetian testing situations, abilities and
willingness to engage in Piaget’s abstract tasks.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The focus of CHAT shifted towards Vygotsky’s cultural focus, where
cognition remains relevant to our cultures.</li>
<li>CHAT refers to contemporary revisions of Vygotsky’s theory,
incorporating the influence of education on learning and
development.</li>
<li>Acculturated adults and peers impart the meanings, values and goals
of the group (which are gradually internalised) on the child throughout
his or her development.</li>
<li>Culturally relevant activities are the primary vehicle through which
individual integration is achieved (rather than Piaget’s fixed stages)
at differing junctures.</li>
<li>In the CHAT paradigm, cultural learning is not a generalised process
to all.</li>
<li>Individuals are contextually educated by their given culture,
through participation in the relevant cultural activities.</li>
<li>Over time, generational participation in such cultural activities
also imparts influence on the culture.</li>

<h5>Factors Affecting Cognitive Development</h5>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Nature vs. Nurture
</h4>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Nativism
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nativists believe that human characteristics are largely (or
entirely) determined biologically.</li>
<li>These researchers position themselves on the “nature” side of the
debate, and attribute human development to genetics.</li>
<li>This perspective assumes that we are born with the blueprint for all
of our abilities and characteristics, they are hard-wired into us, and
predetermined before we’re even born.</li>
<li>Under this paradigm, our ability to learn new concepts is limited by
our biological make-up, our ability to develop cognitively is capped by
a pre-determined set of plans laid out by our genetics.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Empiricism
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Empiricists believe our environment, experiences, and upbringing
(nurture) is the driving force behind human development.</li>
<li>It can be considered that differences in our individual cognitive
development between largely attributes to differences in live experience
and interactions with the environment.</li>
<li>It is learning and our upbringing that governs our cognitive
development.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Epigenetics
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Epigenetics is an emerging field of research that describes the way
our experiences (nurture) affect the expression of our genetics
(nature).</li>
<li>This position falls somewhere between nativism and empiricism.</li>
<li>Our genetics determine what may be possible, but only some genes
will be “switched on” based on our environment and experiences.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Biological factors
</h4>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Birth Weight
</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is some evidence to suggest that lower birth weight may be
associated with disruptions in cognitive development, however, the
research in this domain appears to be mixed.</li>
<li>Some research shows there is no effect of low birth weight on
cognitive development, while other research suggests the effect could be
measured by IQ at age 5.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Genetics
</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is evidence to suggest that, at least in part, genetics may
play a role in cognitive development.</li>
<li>A study of 8-21 year olds showed that the below cognitive abilities
are heritable:
<ul>
<li>General Cognition,</li>
<li>Executive Function,</li>
<li>Memory,</li>
<li>Complex Reasoning,</li>
<li>Social Cognition, and</li>
<li>Sensorimotor Speed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Infectious Diseases
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Research suggests that some infectious diseases, such as malaria and
HIV, have been associated with cognitive deficits/delays in
children.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Psychological Factors
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stress:</strong> Many things can be stressful for children,
including injuries, illnesses, school/home expectations, and exposure to
violence and other traumatic experiences.</li>
<li>This childhood stress can affect the brain, and thus cognitive
development.</li>
<li>Specifically, some research suggests that stress can dysregulate the
hypothalamic–pituitary-adrenocortical system, which can affect cognitive
processing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Social/Environmental Factors
</h4>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Caregiver Health and Well-being
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Right from the moment we are born we typically spend most of our
time with specific people (our caregivers).</li>
<li>Research suggests that our interactions with these people may
influence our development.</li>
<li>The quality and quantity of these interactions can be influenced by
the health and well-being of our caregivers.</li>
<li>Caregiver participation in activities that promote language and
problem-solving skills/development have been shown to positively
influence child cognitive development.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Nutrition
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reduced access to healthy and nutritious foods may lead to
deficiencies in children.</li>
<li>For example, iron deficiency and anaemia in infancy and early
childhood have been associated with poorer cognitive development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nutrition may indirectly impact a child via parent nutrition during
pregnancy. Some research has shown that infants of undernourished
mothers had reduced problem-solving abilities compared to infants of not
malnourished mothers. Parental nutrition during pregnancy can also
influence an infant’s birth weight, which we have already discussed may
influence cognitive development.</p>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Socio-Economic Status (SES)
</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are several ways in which socio-economic status can indirectly
influence a child’s cognitive development.</li>
<li>Those living in a low socio-economic status often experience reduced
access to resources, which can include healthy and nutritious
foods.</li>

</h4>
<ul>
<li>Refers to the basic units of sound (<em>phonemes</em>) and the rules
in combining them.</li>
<li>Different languages are comprised of different phonologies, so they
sound foreign to us when we experience them.</li>
<li>Learning how to construct and interpret these phonemes allows us to
understand others and be understood.</li>
<li>Learning and understanding the basic sounds and combinations which
exist in one language, but do not belong to another.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Morphology
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Looks at the formation of words from sounds.</li>
<li>Morphology looks at the root of a verb, and altering either a prefix
or suffix to convey a tense or plurality, for example.</li>
<li>The combination of these components also allows us to convey
meaningful words.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Semantics
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Refers to the meaning conveyed in words and sentences.</li>
<li>The smallest meaningful units of language are called
<em>morphemes</em>:</li>
<li><em>Free Morphemes</em> are words which can be expressed on their
own, such as ‘dog’.</li>
<li><em>Bound Morphemes</em> are word elements that cannot stand on
their own, such as the ‘s’ in ‘dogs’.</li>
<li>The semantics of language allow us to combine free and bound
morphemes in order to contextually change the meaning of words, form
larger and more complex sentences, and comprehend others and be further
understood.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Syntax
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Refers to how words are combined in order to convey meaning:
<ul>
<li>Garfield Odie bit.</li>
<li>Garfield bit Odie.</li>
<li>Odie bit Garfield.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The above sentences demonstrate how the combination and order of
just three words can alter the meaning of a sentence.</li>

<br>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Pragmatics
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Refers to the requirement to adjust our language dependant on the
audience or social context, in order to be understood.</li>
<li><em>Sociolinguistic knowledge</em> refers to an understanding of the
styles of language required in particular circumstances:
<ul>
<li>A 6 year old explaining the rules of a game to a 2 year old,</li>
<li>A 3 year old asking Grandma for a cookie.</li>

<h5>Understand the theories of language development as they relate to
Learning/Empiricist, Nativist, and Interactionist Theories of Language
Development.</h5>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> The Learning/Empiricist
Perspective
</h4>
<ul>
<li>This theory suggests that we learn language through imitation,
reinforcement and correction provided by our caregivers.</li>
<li>Our learning is constructed by our caregivers as we grow, from
babbling to the formation of increasingly sophisticated sentences, with
reinforcement/validation from adults along the way.</li>
<li>Caregivers who encourage conversation, use many novel and
sophisticated words through play, reading and other supportive
interventions are more likely to advance the child’s language skills
beyond their peers.</li>
<li>Parents more predictably reinforce or validate a child’s semantic
language rather than syntax
(i.e. <abbr title="Semantically correct on the sight of a cow, but grammatically incorrect">“Him
Cow!”</abbr>
vs. <abbr title="Grammatically correct, but semantically incorrect on the sighting of a cow.">“There’s
a dog.”</abbr>)</li>
<li>The primary criticism of this theory is that imitation and
reinforcement do not impart grammar or syntax rules, and also that
parents provide this feedback to their children in terms of semantics or
factually correct statements.</li>
<li>Further, caregivers tend to reinforce factual correctness over
grammatical correctness.</li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> The Nativist Perspective
</h4>
<ul>
<li>According to Noam Chomsky and other nativists, language is too
complex to be taught by parents, or through trial and error, but is
learned through a <em>Language Acquisition Device (LAD)</em></li>
<li>The LAD contains a <em>universal grammar</em>, or knowledge about
the syntax of all languages, permitting any child to learn any language
through a suitably large enough vocabulary.</li>
<li>Slobin believed that children have an innate <em>language making
capability (LMC)</em>, providing the cognitive abilities required to
learn language.</li>
<li>These innate abilities allow us to formulate and further develop the
rules of language, allowing us to test, hypothesise and adjust them
through our own attempts to communicate.</li>

alt="Figure 5.1: Nativist Theory" />
<div class="figcaption">Figure 5.1: Nativist Theory</div>
</div>
<p></br></p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting evidence for this perspective includes:
<ul>
<li>Children the world over reach the <em>linguistic universals</em> at
similar ages regardless of place of origin or culture.</li>
<li>The development of language is specific to humans.</li>
<li>The language centres of the brain (Broca’s Area &amp; Wernicke’s
Area) are located in the left hemisphere, with damage to one of these
resulting in <em>aphasia</em>.</li>
<li><em>Broca’s Area</em> is located in the left hemisphere of the
frontal cortex, and is responsible for language production.</li>
<li><em>Wernicke’s Area</em> is located in the temporal lobe of the left
hemisphere, and is responsible for interpreting speech.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Brain Specialisation and Language:</em>
<ul>
<li>These areas of the brain are sensitive to speech from the day of
birth.</li>
<li>Speech sounds elicit a response from the left hemisphere, while
music and non-speech sounds elicit a response from centres in the right
hemisphere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>The sensitive period Hypothesis</em>
<ul>
<li>Language/s are most easily acquired between birth and puberty.</li>
<li>Child aphasics often recover their function within this period
without intervention, while adults require extensive therapies and
interventions to recover a portion of these skills.</li>
<li>It is thought that the unspecialised centres in the right hemisphere
of a child’s brain can develop or recover lost function, where an
adult’s fully developed right hemisphere is unable to assume these
duties.</li>
<li>This is also evident in the language development of parent and child
immigrants to a new country and their ability to communicate as native
speakers.</li>
<li>Children not offered the opportunity to develop language skills
early in life tend to find it most difficult later in life.</li>
<li>Learners of a second language tend to find development of these
skills later in life. There is evidence to confirm that skills required
for communicating in a second language activate different parts of the
brain to those utilised in processing their first language.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Criticisms of the Nativist Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Infant response to language is also reflected in other species
(i.e. rhesus monkeys and chinchillas).</li>
<li>Knowing that specific areas of the brain are responsible for
different aspects of speech and language does not explain how these
areas contribute to the development of language abilities.</li>
<li>The view that language development is biologically programmed does
not explain how (i.e. the explanation for physical growth is identified
through our understanding of nutrition, hormones, etc).</li>
<li>The sole focus of biological mechanisms overlooks the impact of
environmental factors on the development of our language skills.</li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> The Interactionist Perspective
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Posits that language development comes from a combination of
biological maturation, cognitive development, and the constant change of
environment (nature and nurture).</li>
</ul>
<div class="float">

alt="Figure 5.2: Interactionist Theory" />
<div class="figcaption">Figure 5.2: Interactionist Theory</div>
</div>
<p></br></p>
<ul>
<li>Infants and toddlers often express whatever cognitive understandings
they are developing at the time.</li>
<li>Cognitive and language development are intertwined.</li>
<li>While we are biologically prepared to acquire a language (through a
powerful human brain that matures slowly), our development of language
and grammar develops out of necessity in our increasingly complex
interactions with our environments:
<ul>
<li>Infants are taught how to take turns in conversations with
caregivers through repeated opportunities to learn and a supportive
learning environment,</li>
<li>Parents and older siblings address infants and toddlers with short,
simple sentences.</li>
<li>Utterances are spoken slowly, in a high-pitched voice with emphasis
placed on specific words,</li>
<li>The length and complexity of sentences grows over time, in line with
the child’s stage of development, providing exposure to new semantic and
grammatical rules.</li>
<li>This exposure is provided by parents and others as they seek to
<abbr title="a grammatically correct and embellished version of a child's sentence">expand</abbr>,
<abbr title="rephrasing a sentence in an alternately correct arrangement of words">recast</abbr>
or
<abbr title="Maintaining and extending the conversation without expansion or recasting to demonstrate appropriateness">extend</abbr>
conversation.</li>
<li>Children must be active participants in the use of language in order
to develop a deeper understanding of linguistic nuance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While the interactionist perspective is highly favoured over all
theories, it still does not explain how language is acquired.</li>

<li>Infants are able to discriminate between speech and other sounds
within a few days of birth, as well as infer tone and stress.</li>
<li>By 2 months, infants can also recognise phonemes spoken by different

<li>Infants can also discriminate a wider variety of phonemes than
adults, as we lose the ability to identify phonemes that are outside of
our native language.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> The Importance of Intonational
Cues
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Adults reliably vary their tone of voice when attempting to deliver
different message to their infant.</li>
<li>Rising intonation is used to regain attention, offer support, or
elicit positive affect.</li>
<li>2 to 6 month olds often match tone they have just heard.</li>
<li>Infants become increasingly aware in the first year of sounds,
combinations and phrases as well as the rhythms within phrases and
pauses between them.</li>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Pre-linguistic Vocalisations
</h4>
<ul>
<li>The early milestones of
<abbr title="vowel-like sounds that young infants repeat over and over during periods of contentment"><em>cooing</em></abbr>
and
<abbr title="vowel/consonant combinations that infants begin to produce at about 4 to 6 months"><em>babbling</em></abbr>
appear at around 2 and 4 months respectively.</li>
<li>Deaf infants who have deaf parents who use sign language experiment
with gestures in a similar fashion to hearing children.</li>
<li>Within the first 6 months, infants are able to match intonation from
others, while deaf infants begin to fall behind in their ability to
produce accurate phonemes.</li>
<li>10 to 12 month olds begin to differentiate between the different
phonemes and their meanings.</li>
<li>Within the first 6 months, infants begin cooing and babbling in an
effort to harmonise with adult phonemes.</li>
<li>At around 7 to 8 months infants begin to take turns in exchanges
with caregivers, modelling conversation.</li>
<li>Adult caregivers demonstrate the interactional turn taking through
“conversations”, playing games, and prompting participation when it’s
the adult’s turn.</li>

</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Gestures &amp; Non-verbal
responses
</h4>
<ul>
<li>8 to 10 month olds via two types of non-verbal gestures:
<ul>
<li><em>Declarative Gestures:</em> the infant directs the attention of
others through either pointing at or touching the object.</li>
<li><em>Imperative Gestures:</em> the infant attempts to gain permission
through either pointing at an object or through other gestures like
tugging at pant leg.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These are both functional gestures (behaving like words), and are
often used in conjunction with words to ensure effective
communication.</li>
<li>Caregiver attention is central at this age, as infants are unable to
name an object without the guidance of a caregiver.</li>

<h5>Early Linguistic Period</h5>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Overview
</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Early Linguistic (Holophrastic period) is characterised as the
first stage of meaningful speech, through the use of single word phrases
used to represent an entire sentence.</li>
<li><em>Holophrase:</em> Words are constructed from a consonant / vowel
pairing (i.e. “ta”), or repetitions of these (i.e. “Mama”).</li>
<li>Phonological development accelerates from about 30 months onwards,
with motor skill development (vocal tract) taking an individualistic
path regarding specific words that they are attentive to within their
companions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Early Semantics &amp; Vocabulary
</h4>
<ul>
<li>The pace of word learning quickens at 18 to 24 months at around 10
to 20 new words a week.</li>
<li>This growth is referred to as the <em>naming explosion</em>, where
toddlers realise that all things have a name, and they want to learn as
many of them as possible.</li>
<li>The average vocabulary of a 2 year old is around 200 words.</li>
<li>The primary lexical focus is on objects in this period with a focus
on objects they can interact with directly (i.e. balls or shoes), and
objects that move themselves (i.e. animals or vehicles).</li>
<li>Infants also talk about actions they have been exposed to through
<em>multimodal motherese</em>, where understanding is aided by
sensorimotor experience.</li>
<li>Most infants use a <em>referential style</em> (first borns in
particular) of vocabulary referring to people or objects, while later
borns develop an <em>expressive style</em> with vocabulary focussing on
personal/social words (i.e. please, thank-you, don’t, stop it).</li>
<li>First borns are generally introduced to language centred on objects,
while later borns are introduced to language centred on behaviour.</li>
<li>Referential styles are typically modelled by westernised
(individualistic) families, while expressive styles tend to be
encouraged through eastern (collectivist) cultures.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Attaching meaning to words
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toddlers and Word Meanings:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toddlers use fast-mapping to quickly learn word meanings after
limited exposure, with the names of objects acquired more easily than
names of actions or activities.</li>
<li>Even 13-15 month-olds can learn new words through fast-mapping.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Development of Fast-Mapping:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fast-mapping improves with age.</li>
<li>18-20 month-olds learn words when jointly attending to labelled
object/activity.</li>
<li>By 24-30 months, children can infer meanings from overheard words or
amidst competing attention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Word Production and Fast-Mapping:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite fast-mapping, young children have limited word
production.</li>
<li>Study suggests that young toddlers struggle to retrieve known words
from memory for speaking.</li>
<li>Vocabulary gap between comprehension and production due to
difficulty in retrieving words from memory to express.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Vocabulary Development Explanation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Vocabulary explosion occurs later due to inability of 12-15
month-olds to retrieve learned words from memory for speech.</li>

<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Common Errors in Word Use
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toddlers’ Word Meanings:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toddlers often assign different meanings to words compared to
adults.</li>
<li><strong>Overextension:</strong> Using a word for a broader range
than adults would.</li>
<li><strong>Underextension:</strong> Using a word for a narrower range
than adults would.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fast-Mapping and Errors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fast-mapping contributes to overextension and underextension.</li>
<li>Children may generalise perceptual features when attaching
words.</li>
<li>Overextension: Applying “doggie” to all furry, four-legged
animals.</li>
<li>Underextension: Restricting “doggie” only to the family pet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Word Deciphering Complexity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deciphering new word meanings can be complex.</li>
<li>Context matters: Determining if a word refers to an object or an
action.</li>
<li>Ambiguity: Unclear if word refers to an animal’s features, actions,
sounds, etc.</li>
<li>Children must make choices from numerous plausible
possibilities.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Strategies for Inferring Word
Meanings
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Challenges in Word Learning:</strong>
<ul>
<li>How children learn meanings of less obvious words is complex and
ongoing.</li>
<li>Young children, around 2 years old, sensitive to social and
contextual cues for novel speech understanding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Akhter and Associates Study:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with 2-year-olds and adults using unnamed objects.</li>
<li>Absent adult introduced new unnamed object and used the term
“gazzer.”</li>
<li>Many 2-year-olds inferred speaker’s referential intent correctly,
selecting new object.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Strategies for Word Inference:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Young children use cognitive strategies to narrow word meaning
possibilities.</li>
<li>Basic constraints guide inferences about word meanings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Object Scope and Mutual Exclusivity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Object scope constraint: Children assign words to whole objects, not
parts or attributes.</li>
<li>Mutual exclusivity: Children rarely call objects by each other’s
names.</li>
<li>Mutual exclusivity becomes challenging when adults use multiple
words for one object.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lexical Contrast Constraint:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Used when multiple words refer to the same object.</li>
<li>For example, children contrast “doggie” with “cocker spaniel” to
understand distinctive features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical Linguistic Categories:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Contrasting familiar and novel words aids in forming hierarchical
linguistic categories.</li>
<li>Helps children understand relations between objects and
categories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Word Learning through Syntax:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Young language learners infer word meanings from sentence
context.</li>
<li>Example: Hearing “zav” as noun (“This is a zav.”) refers to the toy;
as adjective (“This is a zav one.”) refers to a characteristic.</li>
<li>Syntactical bootstrapping aids in deciphering the meaning of new
verbs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Syntactical Clues in Sentences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sentence structure provides clues to word meanings.</li>
<li>Syntactical bootstrapping especially helpful in understanding new
verbs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Verbs and Sentence Structure:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Verb’s syntax helps determine its meaning.</li>
<li>Children prefer matching videos based on verb meaning in
sentences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Using Familiar Verbs to Infer Nouns:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Children use meaning of familiar verbs to understand the referents
of new nouns.</li>
<li>For example, “Daddy is eating cabbage” links “cabbage” to the leafy
substance being consumed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Proficiency in Syntactical Inference:</strong>
<ul>
<li>By age 3, children are proficient at inferring word meanings from
syntactical cues.</li>
<li>Trust sentence structure when new word’s referent is unclear, even
when other constraints differ.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Holophrases in Infant Language:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Infants’ one-word utterances often called holophrases.</li>
<li>Resemble attempts to convey a full sentence’s meaning.</li>
<li>Serve various functions based on tone and context (Greenfield &amp;
Smith, 1976).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example of Holophrases:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Example of 17-month-old Shelley’s use of “ghetti” (spaghetti).</li>
<li>Used for questioning, naming, requesting, and demanding.</li>
<li>Tone and context influence the meaning conveyed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Basic Language Functions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Infants in holophrastic phase display basic language functions.</li>
<li>Functions include naming, questioning, requesting, and
demanding.</li>
<li>Functions later carried out through different sentence types.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pragmatic Lesson:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Infants learn that one-word messages can be ambiguous.</li>
<li>Accompanying gestures or intonational cues may be needed for
understanding (Ingram, 1989).</li>

<h5>Understand key events and processes associated with language
development in the telegraph and pre-school period.</h5>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Overview
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emergence of Simple Sentences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Around 18 to 24 months, children start forming simple
sentences.</li>
<li>These sentences are similar across diverse languages (e.g., English,
German, Finnish, Samoan).</li>
<li>Often referred to as telegraphic speech due to containing key
content words.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Focus on Nouns and Verbs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Children stress nouns and verbs in their early sentences.</li>
<li>Telegraphic speech omits less critical parts like articles,
prepositions, auxiliary verbs.</li>
<li>Children still understand full grammatical sentences better than
telegraphic versions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Processing and Production Constraints:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Telegraphic speech might be due to children’s own processing and
production limitations.</li>
<li>Shorter utterances emphasise crucial words for effective
communication.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Variations Across Languages:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Telegraphic speech is not universal; it varies by language.</li>
<li>Russian and Turkish children often produce reasonably grammatical
sentences.</li>
<li>Languages stress different aspects; children acquire what’s most
noticeable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Language Structure Acquisition:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Children acquire what’s most emphasised in a language’s
structure.</li>
<li>Content words and word order rules take precedence in languages like
English.</li>
<li>Telegraphic utterances prioritise crucial information while omitting
less stressed elements.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> A Semantic Analysis of
Telegraphic Speech
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viewing Child Language as Foreign Language:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Psycholinguists treat early child language as a foreign language to
understand its rules.</li>
<li>They aim to describe the sentence-forming rules that young children
use.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Early Syntax in Telegraphic Speech:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Early analyses showed that many two-word sentences in telegraphic
speech followed some grammatical rules.</li>
<li>English-speaking children tend to use specific word orders for
conveying meaning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Limitations of Syntax-Only Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Focusing solely on syntax underestimated children’s linguistic
abilities.</li>
<li>Same two-word utterance might convey different meanings in different
contexts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Context and Semantic Intent:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Interpretation of telegraphic speech requires considering the
child’s semantic intent.</li>
<li>Contexts in which utterances are made are essential to understanding
their meaning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Example of Changing Meaning:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Example of “Mommy sock” used in two instances with different
meanings.</li>
<li>Context helps determine whether it implies possession or an action
happening.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> The Pragmatics of early speech
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supplementing Words with Gestures:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Incomplete early sentences and ambiguous meanings lead children to
use gestures and intonational cues alongside words for better
communication.</li>
<li>Deaf children can develop sophisticated languages based entirely on
non-verbal signs and gestures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Importance of Non-verbal Communication:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Non-verbal gestures play a significant role in effective
communication, even though they might seem limited to spoken language
experts.</li>
<li>Many deaf children use non-verbal signs and gestures to communicate
(AUSLAN).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Understanding Social and Situational Cues:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toddlers become sensitive to social and situational factors for
effective communication.</li>
<li>They learn vocal turn-taking and cues for yielding the floor in
conversations.</li>
<li>They adjust their distance and voice volume based on the listener’s
proximity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Considering Partners’ Knowledge:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toddlers choose conversational topics and requests based on their
partners’ knowledge.</li>
<li>They prefer discussing events not known to their partners.</li>
<li>Requests for assistance are more elaborate when partners are unaware
of the object’s location.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Clarifying Communication:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Toddlers monitor others’ verbal responses and clarify misunderstood
utterances.</li>
<li>They correct failed messages by rephrasing and adding emphasis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Learning Sociolinguistic Norms:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Young children learn sociolinguistic norms, like politeness in
speech.</li>
<li>Parents inadvertently teach etiquette through prompts like “What do
you say?” or “Say the magic word.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Pre-School Period
</h4>
<ul>
<li>From <span class="math inline">\(2\frac{1}{2}\ to\ 5\)</span> years
of age children begin to produce sentences that are complex and
adult-like.</li>
<li>A much deeper understanding of the pragmatics of language is

<h5>Factors That Influence Motor Development</h5>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Sex Differences in Motor
Development
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minor sex differences are observed in motor development during early
childhood.</li>
<li>Boys tend to excel in activities that require muscle strength, such
as throwing a ball.</li>
<li>Girls show a slight advantage in activities involving balance and
motor coordination, such as skipping.</li>
<li>Girls also tend to have more developed fine motor coordination than
boys.</li>
<li>These differences may be influenced by social roles and activities
learned in early childhood, with boys engaging more in rough-and-tumble
play and girls in quieter activities like drawing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Cultural Differences in Motor
Development
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cultural differences play a role in motor development, with
childrearing practices varying between societies.</li>
<li>Some cultures encourage and nurture motor development, while others
may have practices that restrict infant movements, potentially slowing
motor development.</li>
<li>For example, Taiwanese infants may exhibit slower motor development
compared to American norms due to cultural differences in childrearing
practices.</li>
<li>On the other hand, some Aboriginal-Australian children from
traditional Western Desert groups have shown superior motor development
compared to urban Aboriginal and Anglo-Australian preschool children,
attributed to different childrearing practices.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Individual Differences
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Within any group, there are significant individual differences in
motor development, with children achieving developmental milestones at
different chronological ages.</li>
<li>These variations can result from disparities in experience,
motivation, biological factors, and environmental influences.</li>
<li>For instance, a child with a naturally tall and muscular body may
master gross motor skills more easily than a smaller child with
different physical characteristics.</li>
<li>Environmental factors, such as opportunities for physical activities
and parental encouragement, also play a role in motor skill
development.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Children with Disabilities
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Children with physical disabilities, like cerebral palsy, may face
challenges in motor development due to impaired motor control
abilities.</li>
<li>Neural damage in the brain can affect their ability to learn motor
skills.</li>
<li>However, the motor development of children with disabilities is not
solely determined by their biological factors; it is also influenced by
opportunities and parental encouragement.</li>
<li>These children can achieve a diverse range of motor achievements
with appropriate support and intervention.</li>

<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> A Note on Language
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The language used to discuss the various conditions that fall
under the neurodiversity umbrella is continuously evolving.</p></li>
<li><p>Well-informed use of terminology can empower and support the
neurodivergent community and can also shape broader perceptions of each
condition.</p></li>
<li><p>The language used aims to accurately reflect contemporary
understandings of neurodiversity, and the unique ways in which members
of the neurodivergent community have expressed that they would like to
be referred to.</p></li>
<li><p>Different language preferences could be held by different
individuals, in different contexts and at different times.</p></li>
<li><p>The term ‘autism’ will be used when referring to Autism Spectrum
Disorder.</p></li>
<li><p>Language preferences and recommendations expressed by a large
proportion of autistic advocates and researchers employ identity first
language (e.g. autistic person), as a primary preference.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of identity first language reflects increasing
recognition that autistic people having the most intimate expertise of
their perspectives through lived experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Identity-first language is also used to acknowledge being
autistic as an integral part of a person’s identity that cannot be
separated from oneself.</p></li>
<li><p>The language used when referring to ADHD will alternatively, use
person-first language (e.g. child with ADHD).</p></li>
<li><p>This approach emphasises that ADHD is one aspect of someone’s
identity, and has been argued to reduce stigma and promote a healthier
self-understanding of individuals with the condition.</p></li>
<li><p>As identity-first language has been associated with emotive and
problem focused language in ADHD specifically, the use of person-first
language in this context aims to reflects strengths-based perspectives
of ADHD.</p></li>

<h3>Autism</h3>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Overview
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by the
presence of differences in social interaction, communication, and
repetitive behaviours and restricted interests.</li>
<li>Social and communicative characteristics present as differences in
communication styles, where autistic people experience difficulties
engaging in fluid and flexible reciprocal conversations with
non-autistic people, and display less awareness of the emotional,
interpersonal or non-verbal cues of others.</li>
<li>Autistic people can also have a single abiding interest, in which
all play, enjoyment, and learning is focused on.</li>
<li>They also may engage in repetitive, stereotyped patterns of movement
(‘stimming’), which are often a coping response to sensory
overload.</li>
<li>Autism has also been associated with increased rates of other
neurodiversities and mental health conditions.</li>
<li>Possibly due to shared underlying biological mechanisms, between
40%-70% of autistic people also identify with ADHD.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> DSM-5-TR Diagnostic Criteria

<li>Absence of interest in peers</li>
</ul>
<p>Criterion B: Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of

</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Prevalence
</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is estimated that approximately 1 in 70 Australians, yet 1 in 33
Victorian children are autistic.</li>
<li>Through increased focus on early identification and heightened
awareness and understanding of the condition, Australia has seen one of
the largest growing prevalence rates of autism in children in recent
years.</li>
<li>Current estimates indicate 1.1%-1.3% of Australian children (6-12
years) are autistic.</li>
<li>The rising prevalence of autism in Australia has significant
implications for individuals, families, and society as a whole.</li>
<li>It also highlights a growing need for neuro-affirming and accessible
support services, and the need for healthcare professionals, educators,
and community members to work collaboratively to address the needs and
priorities of autistic people and their families.</li>
<li>Males are overrepresented among the autistic community, being 2 to 3
times more likely to have a formal diagnosis than females.</li>
<li>The disparity between male and female diagnosis rates may be that
autism presents differently in boys and girls.</li>
<li>Girls present with advanced social and communicative skills, and
engage in masking strategies to camouflage their authentic autistic
behaviours and difficulties with social interactions. They also
demonstrate specialised interests that are more similar to those of
non-autistic girls and engage in less repetitive behaviour
patterns.</li>
<li>Girls can be overlooked or misdiagnosed in childhood, and are more
likely to attain their diagnosis later in life.</li>
<li>Delayed diagnosis in girls impacts later abilities to develop
self-understanding, an authentic identity and attain relevant supports
needed to thrive.</li>
<li>Positive societal shifts in recent years have begun to raise
awareness on the autistic female experience, and facilitate appropriate
support to enhance developmental outcomes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Heterogeneity and ‘Spiky’
Profile
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Autism is considered a heterogeneous condition.</li>
<li>Despite sharing common traits, each autistic individual has distinct
set of language, sensory, executive function, perception, and motor
skills and qualities that are unique to them.</li>
<li>As each person experiences varying strengths or difficulties in each
domain, they each experience the world around them differently to other
autistic and non-autistic people.</li>
<li>With an increasing awareness and understanding of autism, Australia
has made significant strides in providing support and services for
autistic people and their families.</li>
<li>Challenges remain in diagnosis, access to inclusive and
neuro-affirming support and education, and societal acceptance.</li>

<h3>ADHD</h3>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Overview
</h4>
<p>ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental condition characterised by the
presence of three main features: (1) Inattention; (2) Hyperactivity; and
(3) Impulsivity (American-Psychiatric Association [APA], 2022). People
with ADHD can sometimes experience variable patterns of attention, where
cognitively demanding activities such as inhibiting or regulating
attention, as well as maintaining focus on topics or activities that are
not of personal interest, can be more difficult than those without ADHD.
This can also impact abilities to plan and problem solve, recall recent
information, and self-reflect in the moment. Individuals with ADHD can
also possess high levels of energy and need to move their bodies
frequently than those without ADHD. One of the key neurological
differences in the brains of people with ADHD is under-activation or
reduced stimulation of various neural systems and pathways, which
results in an under-active reward system and less dopamine in the brain
(da Silva et al., 2023). Partially due to these differences, some people
may make decisions quickly, or seek out behaviours that have an
immediate rewarding effect on the brain to attain optimal levels of
brain stimulation. People with ADHD may also require more support with
self-monitoring and emotion regulation than non-ADHD peers.</p>
<p>The DSM-5-TR recognises three major subtypes of ADHD, which
include:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>
Predominantly Inattentive
</th>
<th>
Predominantly Hyperactive
</th>
<th>
Combined Type
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>
Individuals can demonstrate differences in their ability to concentrate
and maintain focus over time and across settings.
</li>
<li>
Some children and adolescents may need more time to understand concepts,
plan, and initiate tasks that require a large amount of cognitive effort
or require a series of several steps.
</li>
<li>
They may also find managing their time and organisation difficult.
</li>
<li>
Many therefore benefit from support managing their belongings and
personal activities.
</li>
<li>
This is the most common subtype of ADHD, and more frequently observed
among females.
</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>
Individuals can have higher levels of energy, display increased levels
of excitement, and respond to factors in their environment more rapidly
than same-aged peers.
</li>
<li>
Hyperactivity also includes increased bodily movements, such as frequent
fidgeting and an increased desire to move one’s body irrespective of the
social context.
</li>
<li>
Increased energy can also be seen in speech, where individuals can speak
more frequently or quickly during social interactions.
</li>
<li>
Some children and adolescents can also exhibit reduced tolerance to
boredom and more difficulty inhibiting their impulses.
</li>
<li>
Some can also make decisions or engage in behaviours more spontaneously
than children and adolescents without ADHD.
</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>
This involves a combination of characteristics and experiences of both
inattention and hyperactivity.
</li>
</li>
This subtype is more frequently identified in males.

<p>ADHD is highly heterogeneous and considered a spectrum condition,
with each individual exhibiting a variable and unique collection of
characteristics that are unique to them. Over 60% of people with ADHD
also have a co-occurring neurodiversity or mental health condition (da
Silva et al., 2023). ADHD most frequently co-occurs with autism (15%-64%
of people with ADHD are autistic); Dyslexia (50% of people with ADHD are
dyslexic); and Developmental Coordination Disorder (50% [ADHD Aware
2024; Zhong &amp; Porter, 2024).</p>

<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> DSM-5-TR Diagnostic Criteria
</h4>
<p>A summary of the DSM-5-TR criteria for
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is presented below and
uses direct language from the DSM-5-TR. To meet each of the subtypes,
children are required to display six or more of the nine possible
characteristics described in criterion A or B (or both if the individual
has ADHD-combined type). Symptoms must be evident for at least 6 months
to be able to meet each specific criterion.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion A: Inattention</strong></p>
<p>Six (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted for at least 6
months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and
that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational
activities:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Attention to Detail: Often fails to give close attention to details
or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other
activities (e.g., overlooks or misses details, work is inaccurate).</li>
<li>Sustained Attention: Often has difficulty sustaining attention in
tasks or play activities (e.g., has difficulty remaining focused during
lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading).</li>
<li>Attention when Spoken To: Often does not seem to listen when spoken
to directly (e.g., mind seems elsewhere, even in the absence of any
obvious distraction).</li>
<li>Following Instructions: Often does not follow through on
instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the
workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focus and is easily
sidetracked).</li>
<li>Organisation: Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities
(e.g., difficulty managing sequential tasks; difficulty keeping
materials and belongings in order; messy, disorganized work; has poor
time management; fails to meet deadlines).</li>
<li>Avoidance of Cognitively Demanding Tasks: Often avoids, dislikes, or
is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort
(e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents and adults,
preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers).</li>
<li>Misplacing Items: Often loses things necessary for tasks or
activities (e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets,
keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones).</li>
<li>Distractibility: Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli
(for older adolescents and adults, may include unrelated thoughts).</li>
<li>Daily Activities: Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g.,
doing chores, running errands; for older adolescents and adults,
returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Criterion B: Hyperactivity</strong></p>
<p>Hyperactivity and impulsivity: Six (or more) of the following
symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is
inconsistent with developmental level and that negatively impacts
directly on social and academic/occupational activities: a. Fidgeting
Behaviour: Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat.
b. Leaving Seat when Seating is Expected: Often leaves seat in
situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g., leaves his or her
place in the classroom, in the office or other workplace, or in other
situations that require remaining in place). c. Movement when Socially
Not Required: Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is
inappropriate. (Note: In adolescents or adults, may be limited to
feeling restless.) d. Quiet Play: Often unable to play or engage in
leisure activities quietly. e. Excessive Activity: Is often “on the go,”
acting as if “driven by a motor” (e.g., is unable to be or uncomfortable
being still for extended time, as in restaurants, meetings; may be
experienced by others as being restless or difficult to keep up with).
f. Increased Speech: Often talks excessively. g. Reciprocal
Conversations: Often blurts out an answer before a question has been
completed (e.g., completes people’s sentences; cannot wait for turn in
conversation). h. Turn Taking: Often has difficulty waiting his or her
turn (e.g., while waiting in line). i. Interruption or Intrusion: Often
interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations, games,
or activities; may start using other people’s things without asking or
receiving permission; for adolescents and adults, may intrude into or
take over what others are doing).</p>
<p><strong>Criterion B: Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive
symptoms were present prior to age 12 years.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Criterion C: Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive
symptoms are present in two or more settings</strong> (e.g., at home,
school, or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).</p>
<p><strong>Criterion D: Features of inattention and/or
hyperactivity/impulsivity interfere with, or reduce the quality of,
social, academic, or occupational functioning.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Criterion E: Features of inattention and/or
hyperactivity/impulsivity are not better explained by other mental
health conditions.</strong></p>

<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Prevalence
</h4>
<ul>
<li>ADHD is one of the most common conditions observed in childhood, and
the most common neurodevelopmental condition in children and
adolescents.</li>
<li>Current prevalence estimates indicate that 6%-10% of children in
Australia, and 5%-8% of the world’s population meet diagnostic criteria
for ADHD (ADHD Guideline Developmental Group, 2022).</li>
<li>While trends in the prevalence of ADHD have remained relatively
stable over time, there has been a recent surge in awareness and
identification of ADHD particularly in adult females, whose rates of
diagnosis have doubled since 2020 (Russell et al., 2024).</li>
<li>Despite previous misconceptions that children ‘outgrowing’ ADHD, it
is now recognised as a lifespan condition experienced throughout
adulthood.</li>
<li>However, the expression of key traits exhibit normative changes
across development, with features such as hyperactivity changing from
externalised behaviours in childhood to feelings of ‘mental
restlessness’ in adulthood (Martz et al., 2021).</li>
<li>Many individuals also develop personalised strategies to mitigate
difficulties related executive function differences that also reduce
overt ADHD symptoms and improve overall outcomes.</li>
<li>Historically, ADHD was considered a distinctively male condition,
with previous reviews showing that boys were two to three times more
likely to present with ADHD than girls (Rucklidge, 2010).</li>
<li>However, more recent studies now show an equal prevalence of ADHD
across males and females (Faheem et al., 2022).</li>
<li>The change in disproportionate sex ratios has been partially
attributed to an increase in awareness of ADHD in females, and
recognition of girls presenting with a unique collection of sex-specific
characteristics, traits, and behaviours.</li>
<li>Unlike boys who typically exhibit externalising behaviours and
hyperactivity related characteristics, girls often present with features
of inattention, and emotion regulation difficulties.</li>
<li>They are also more likely to display internalising over
externalising symptoms including reduced self esteem, depression, and
anxiety (Morgan, 2023).</li>
<li>As externalising behaviours (commonly seen in boys) are more likely
to result in the identification of ADHD and subsequent diagnosis, girls’
more subtle features of inattention can be missed or underestimated at
home and educational settings (Attoe et al., 2023; Morgan, 2023).</li>
<li>Girls are also more likely to mask both their ADHD characteristics
and associated learning difficulties across various settings.</li>
<li>While masking is a strategy used to reduce perceived differences to
others, it also contributes to poor mental health, and girls’ needs
being unrecognised or overlooked particularly by educators (Hinshaw et
al., 2022).</li>
<li>As a result of reduced societal and professional awareness of ADHD
in girls, females are more likely to attain their diagnoses in
adulthood, or receive inaccurate diagnoses that reflect their
internalising symptoms (depression, anxiety etc.) rather than ADHD
(Morgan, 2023).</li>
<li>Despite the impact that differences in understanding of ADHD may
have on girls’ opportunities for appropriate identification and support
provision, greater attention being paid to ADHD in females is likely to
result in increased societal and individual understanding, timely
diagnosis, and the provision of affirming practices to allow females to
thrive.</li>

<h4>
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> Aetiology of ADHD
</h4>
<p>Like all neurodiversities, the mechanisms underlying the development
of ADHD are multifactorial, and involve a complex interplay between
various genetic, neurobiological, and prenatal environmental factors
that are unique for each person. Current findings from
genetic–environmental studies support the hypothesis that genetic
factors can lead to the development of ADHD by determining a developing
infant’s responses to environmental exposures, particularly during the
perinatal period.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic Factors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The genetic contribution of ADHD is relatively high, with total
heritability of ADHD ranging from 70%-80%.</li>
<li>Genetic researchers have moved away from aiming to identify a single
candidate gene implicated in ADHD development to instead propose that
there are multiple genes associated with ADHD that each exert a small
influence that lead to its aetiology.</li>
<li>The identified genes implicated in ADHD are also not unique to ADHD
and have also been identified as those that play a role in the risk for
other neurodiversities.</li>
<li>The genetic underpinning of ADHD has been further supported by
evidence from large population based twin and family studies
(N=1,656,943), which have cited a 75%-95% concordance rates among
monozygotic twin pairs.</li>
<li>These studies have also observed an 8-fold increase of ADHD in
siblings and dizygotic twin pairs.</li>
<li>Meta-analytic studies have likewise supported the genetic basis of
ADHD, where parents with ADHD are two to eight times more likely to have
a child with ADHD than parents without ADHD.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Environmental Factors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prenatal and postnatal environmental factors have been the most
frequently associated environmental correlates associated with ADHD
risk.</li>
<li>While environmental factors account for 10-30% of ADHD aetiology, it
is unclear whether these factors may be causal, or partly confounded by
genetic factors.</li>
<li>In this context, genetic variations increase risk of a developing
infant being exposed to the environmental factors associated with
increased vulnerability for ADHD.
<ul>
<li>For example, although smoking during pregnancy was previously
postulated as a risk factor for ADHD, family based studies have now
shown that the association is better explained by unmeasured family
confounding, where shared genetic factors increase the risk of maternal
smoking during pregnancy in women who have genetic underpinnings for
ADHD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Evidently, the extent that environmental factors may be evident
(e.g. a maternal smoking), and play a role in ADHD, may be better
explained by underlying genetic factors rather than environmental risk
alone.</li>
<li>With this new evidence, environmental factors are now viewed as
correlated or confounded with ADHD risk (through genetics) rather than
as causal risk factors.</li>
<li>While potential environmental correlates are varied and need
separate and comprehensive trials to be established as ADHD risk
factors.</li>
<li>Despite this, the most commonly cited environmental risk factors
include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Prenatal Maternal Conditions or Maternal risk
Factors:</strong> Maternal stress during pregnancy; Pre-pregnancy
obesity</li>
<li><strong>Exposure to Teratogens in Utero:</strong> Maternal smoking
in pregnancy; Maternal alcohol use in pregnancy; Illicit substance use
during pregnancy; Exposure to environmental toxins such as lead and
pollutants<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Infant or Obstetric Risk Factors:</strong> Premature birth
(&lt;26 weeks of gestational age); Low birth weight</li>
<li><strong>Postnatal Factors:</strong> Maternal Postnatal Depression;
Severe early psychosocial deprivation; Harsh or coercive early parenting
which significantly disrupts parent-attachment relationships.</li>
<li>Each of these parenting factors or behaviours influence levels of
responsivity, sensitivity, and reactivity to children, which impacts
mother-child relationships and increases risk of adverse developmental
outcomes.</li>
