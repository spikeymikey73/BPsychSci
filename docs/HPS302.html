<h5>
<i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Sources of Change
</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normative Age-Graded Influences</strong>: the influences of
age that affect most adults as they grow older:
<ul>
<li><strong>Biology</strong>: A common part of aging referenced by our
<strong>biological clock</strong>, such as greying hair, wrinkly skin,
and losing of strength and muscle mass.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Experiences</strong>: While not nearly as relevant
for current generations as it was for previous generations, our
<strong>social clock</strong> remains a guide for life events such as
starting a family, leaving home, graduating from university, etc.
<ul>
<li>Our position on this social clock can impact our self-worth if we
consider ourselves out of sync with societal expectations of the
normative timing of life events.</li>
<li>Many consider these achievements outside the social norm to be
considerable achievements.</li>
<li>Instances of <strong>Ageism</strong> are also governed by the social
clock affecting both emerging adults and older adults.</li>
<li>Parenting can have a significant impact on a parent’s social clock
as experiences are governed by the requirements of a child’s age and
developmental stage, with parents being drawn together based on their
shared experiences.</li>
<li>Experiences in this domain are far less likely to be universal than
those governed by the biological clock.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Internal Change Processes</strong>: Parents have been
observed to exemplify more traditional masculine and feminine traits as
young adults, while older parents seek to balance or extend these
traits.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normative History-Graded Influences</strong>: Historical
events can shape both similarities and dissimilarities between people in
similar groups (i.e. single child families in China)
<ul>
<li><strong>Culture</strong> can shape the expected age of:
<ul>
<li>Marriage or childbearing,</li>
<li>The typical number of children (and wives),</li>
<li>The roles of men and women,</li>
<li>Class structures,</li>
<li>Religious practices, and</li>
<li>Laws.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cohort</strong>: A group of people within a similar stage of
life sharing similar historical experiences (i.e. Cuban Americans in the
60s, children of the Great Depression, children of COVID).
<ul>
<li>Smaller than a generation (SG, BB, X, Y, Z).</li>
<li>Can refer to the people within a country or region of a
country.</li>
<li>The effects of the Great Depression differed between teens (showed
greater independence and resilience) and primary school children
(extended periods of hardship).</li>
<li>Other examples of the influences on cohorts include:
<ul>
<li>Economic conditions of the times,</li>
<li>Political and religious climate,</li>
<li>Educational system, and</li>
<li>Popular culture.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-normative Life Events</strong>
<ul>
<li>Examples of non-normative life events can include:
<ul>
<li>The death of a spouse in early adulthood,</li>
<li>Inheriting enough money to retire at age 40,</li>
<li>Taking over parental responsibility for grandchildren, and</li>
<li>Starting your own business at 65.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These events can be non-normative at any age (large inheritance),
while others are non-normative due to the timing (death of a
spouse).</li>
<li>The events that occur “on-time” can be easier to deal with than
those that are “off-time”.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="sources-of-stability" class="section level5 alert alert-info">
<h5><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Sources of Stability</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Genetics (Nature)</strong>
<ul>
<li>At conception, each individual inherits a unique combination of
genes.</li>
<li>While most genes are shared across the human species (shaping common
developmental patterns like walking at 12 months or puberty in the early
teens), genetic inheritance also contributes to individual differences:
<ul>
<li>The field of <strong>behaviour genetics</strong> studies how genes
influence various traits, including:<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive abilities</strong> (e.g., IQ).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Physical traits</strong> (e.g., height, body shape,
metabolism).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Personality characteristics</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Psychological disorders</strong> (e.g., alcoholism,
schizophrenia, depression).<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Research suggests that heredity plays a key role in
<strong>stability across development</strong>, as many genetic traits
and tendencies persist throughout life.<br />
</li>
<li>Behaviour geneticists use <strong>twin studies</strong> to examine
genetic influences on adult behaviour. These studies compare:
<ul>
<li><strong>Monozygotic (identical) twins</strong>, who share
<strong>100% of their genes</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Dizygotic (fraternal) twins</strong>, who share
<strong>about 50% of their genes</strong>, like any other
siblings.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In a typical study, researchers measure a trait or ability in both
twins and compare their similarity.</li>
<li>Research suggests that the higher similarity of identical than
fraternal twins is more genetically influenced rather than shaped by
environmental factors.<br />
</li>
<li>Twin studies require <strong>large sample sizes</strong>, making
recruitment difficult.<br />
</li>
<li>To overcome this, countries with <strong>centralised birth and
health records</strong> have taken the lead in this research.<br />
</li>
<li>The <strong>largest twin database</strong> is at the
<strong>Karolinska Institute in Sweden</strong>, which maintains records
on <strong>over 85,000 twin pairs</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environment (Nurture)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Both <strong>genetics and environment</strong> contribute to
stability in personal development.</li>
<li>While neither determines destiny, both have lasting effects.<br />
</li>
<li>The <strong>Grant Study of Harvard Men</strong>, led by psychiatrist
<strong>George Vaillant (2002)</strong>, found that:
<ul>
<li>Men from <strong>warm, trusting homes</strong> were more likely to
lead <strong>well-adjusted</strong> adult lives.<br />
</li>
<li>They expressed emotions openly, trusted others, and maintained
strong friendships.<br />
</li>
<li>Parental warmth fostered <strong>self-worth, coping skills, and
meaningful relationships</strong>.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vaillant’s research also linked <strong>early childhood
environment</strong> to <strong>successful ageing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Those from supportive homes were <strong>healthier and
happier</strong> at age 75.<br />
</li>
<li>Those from bleak homes faced <strong>loneliness, mistrust, and
illness</strong> later in life.<br />
</li>
<li>These findings contributed to <strong>Vaillant’s theory of
personality development</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interactionist View</strong>
<ul>
<li>There is no clear division between <strong>genes and
environment</strong>, as they interact to shape stability throughout
adulthood.</li>
<li>The <strong>interactionist perspective</strong> suggests that
genetic traits influence how individuals engage with their environment,
which in turn reinforces those traits.<br />
</li>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>A <strong>risk-averse child</strong> may seek low-risk activities,
form friendships with similar individuals, and be guided toward a
cautious career path.<br />
</li>
<li>Over time, their lifestyle continues to reflect <strong>risk
avoidance</strong>, reinforcing their behaviours and experiences.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The interactionist view sees Nature vs. Nurture as a
<strong>chicken-and-egg dilemma</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>A biological mechanism, <strong>epigenetic inheritance</strong>,
explains how <strong>environmental experiences modify gene
expression</strong>.</li>
<li>This process, called <strong>DNA methylation</strong>, alters genes
by adding a methyl group, reducing gene expression.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Childhood Abuse and Lifelong Genetic Changes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Research on <strong>suicide victims</strong> found that those with a
history of childhood abuse had modified <strong>glucocorticoid receptor
genes</strong>.</li>
<li>This influences <strong>stress responses</strong> compared to those
without a history of childhood abuse.<br />
</li>
<li>This suggests that <strong>early life experiences</strong> can lead
to <strong>permanent genetic changes</strong> with lifelong
consequences.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>These findings highlight the complex interplay between
<strong>genetics and environment</strong>, shaping development in ways
far beyond what is inherited at birth.b</li>

<i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> On Ageing
</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chronological Age and Development</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chronological age</strong> refers to the number of years
since birth, often marked by birthdays.</li>
<li>While it is significant in <strong>childhood</strong> (as children
of the same age tend to have similar abilities and interests), it
becomes <strong>less relevant in adulthood</strong>, except in specific
cases like:
<ul>
<li><strong>Young adulthood</strong> – Legal milestones (e.g., driving,
purchasing alcohol, voting).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Older adulthood</strong> – Eligibility for benefits (e.g.,
Social Security, Medicare).<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, <strong>chronological age does not cause
development</strong>—aging is not simply a result of time passing or
birthday candles burning. While <strong>age may be related to
developmental changes, it is not the direct cause</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biological Age and Physical Condition</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biological age</strong> measures how an individual’s
<strong>physical condition</strong> compares to others of different
ages. Informal examples include:
<ul>
<li>“He has the <strong>memory of a 50-year-old</strong>.”<br />
</li>
<li>“She <strong>runs like a 30-year-old</strong>.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The meaning of <strong>biological age</strong> depends on
<strong>chronological age</strong> (a 30-year-old with the memory of a
50-year-old may raise concerns), whereas a 70-year-old with the same
memory would seem youthful.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Biological age is often assessed through medical
evaluations</strong>, such as <strong>bone density scans</strong>,
comparing patients’ bones to those of a healthy 20-year-old.</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong> can influence biological age,
potentially slowing or reversing some aspects of aging.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psychological, Social, and Functional Age</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Psychological age</strong> refers to an individual’s ability
to effectively navigate life compared to others. For example:
<ul>
<li>A <strong>30-year-old</strong> who overspends and is often late for
work functions more like a <strong>teenager</strong>.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Social age</strong> is based on the roles a person assumes
at different life stages:
<ul>
<li>A <strong>40-year-old first-time mother</strong> has a
<strong>social age</strong> younger than her chronological age.<br />
</li>
<li>A <strong>23-year-old supporting her family</strong> has a
<strong>social age</strong> beyond her years.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functional Age and Measuring Development</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, <strong>biological, psychological, and social
age</strong> are grouped as <strong>functional age</strong>, reflecting
<strong>overall adult functioning</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Developmental psychologists recognise that <strong>chronological age
alone is not a reliable measure</strong> of adult behaviour. Instead,
studies often compare:
<ul>
<li><strong>Different age groups</strong> (e.g., young vs. middle-aged
adults).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Different roles</strong> (e.g., couples with vs. without
children).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The same individuals before and after major life
transitions</strong> (e.g., parenthood, retirement).<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This highlights that <strong>development and chronological age do
not always align</strong>, especially as people grow older.</li>

<i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Bioecological Model of Development
</h5>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>bioecological model</strong> emphasizes that human
development occurs within multiple interacting environments—biological,
psychological, and social—which change over time.</li>
<li>Introduced by <strong>Urie Bronfenbrenner</strong> in 1979 and later
refined, the model consists of five systems:
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsystem</strong> (immediate environment like family and
friends)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Mesosystem</strong> (interactions between elements in the
microsystem)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Exosystem</strong> (indirect influences, such as parental
workplaces)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Macrosystem</strong> (cultural and societal
influences)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Chronosystem</strong> (changes over time, including personal
growth and historical events)<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The key idea is that <strong>development cannot be studied in
isolation</strong>—it must be understood in the context of
relationships, communities, and broader cultural influences.</li>
<li>Modern research increasingly applies this model to study adults in
various roles, including as individuals, partners, parents, workers, and
members of cultural groups.</li>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Thematic analysis is a <strong>qualitative research</strong> method
used to identify, analyse, and interpret patterns (themes) within
textual data. It helps researchers make sense of large amounts of
information by categorizing recurring ideas, meanings, or

<ul>
<li><strong>Key Steps in Thematic Analysis:</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Familiarization</strong> – Reading and re-reading the data
to gain an overall understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong> – Identifying meaningful segments of text
and assigning labels (codes) to them.</li>
<li><strong>Searching for Themes</strong> – Grouping similar codes into
broader themes that represent key patterns in the data.</li>
<li><strong>Reviewing Themes</strong> – Refining themes by checking
their relevance and coherence with the dataset.</li>
<li><strong>Defining and Naming Themes</strong> – Clearly articulating
what each theme represents.</li>
<li><strong>Writing the Report</strong> – Presenting findings with

<ul>
<li>Qualitative research explores human experiences, meanings, and

not objective and that knowledge (<strong>epistemology</strong>) is
shaped by context, researcher interpretation and previous
experiences.</li>
<li>Braun and Clarke (2021) consider qualitative research based in this
philosophy as a genuine form of qualitative research and label this
approach <strong>‘Big Q’</strong>.</li>
<li>Approaches which do not follow the ‘Big Q’ view of qualitative
research are called <strong>‘Small Q’</strong>.</li>
<li>These approaches apply a positivist or post-positivist paradigm and
treat reality as objective and not highly influenced by experiences,
power dynamics or social context.</li>
<li>Reflexive Thematic Analysis is aligned with a ‘Big Q’ approach to
qualitative research.</li>

<li><strong>Familiarisation with Data</strong> – Immerse yourself in the
dataset by reading, re-reading, and making notes on key insights. If
working with audio, listen to recordings at least once.<br />

<li><strong>Role Transitions:</strong> Focuses on how individuals adjust
and how transitions affect other roles.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Early Social Role Theory:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Adulthood was viewed based on the number of roles occupied.<br />
</li>
<li>Early adulthood involved acquiring multiple roles, while later years

<h5>Introduction</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Young Adulthood and Social Role Changes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>More role changes occur during young adulthood than in any other
life stage.<br />
</li>
<li>Emerging adults explore life paths while their roles remain similar
to adolescence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Common Role Transitions in Young Adulthood:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Leaving student life and entering the workforce.<br />
</li>
<li>Becoming independent from parents.<br />
</li>
<li>Entering committed relationships or marriage.<br />
</li>
<li>Becoming a parent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Varied Paths to Adulthood:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some follow a structured path: high school → college/career training
→ financial independence → moving out.<br />
</li>
<li>Others take non-linear paths, such as working first, moving back
home, or entering cohabiting relationships.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Benefits of Flexible Transitions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Avoids premature career or marriage commitments.<br />
</li>
<li>Can serve as a turning point for individuals with troubled childhood
trajectories.<br />
</li>
<li>Military service or marriage can help some young adults turn their
lives around.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emerging Adulthood as a New Life Stage (Arnett,
2000):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Occurs roughly between ages 18-25.<br />
</li>
<li>A time of exploration before committing to career and
relationships.<br />
</li>
<li>Defined by five key features (Arnett, 2007):
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Identity exploration</strong> – figuring out personal and
professional identity.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Instability</strong> – frequent changes in jobs,
relationships, and residences.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Self-focus</strong> – greater independence and personal
development.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Feeling in-between</strong> – not fully adolescent but not
fully adult.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Possibilities</strong> – optimism about future
opportunities.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cultural Variations in Emerging Adulthood:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Common in developed countries but varies across cultures.<br />
</li>
<li>Found in urban populations in China, Argentina, Japan, Latin
America, and parts of Europe.<br />
</li>
<li>Less evident in rural or lower-income populations, where young
people take on adult roles earlier, similar to the U.S. before the
1950s.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="leaving-and-returning-home" class="section level5">
<h5>Leaving (and Returning) Home</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Variability in Leaving-Home Process:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Timing and destination of moving out differ widely among young
adults.<br />
</li>
<li>Some leave immediately, while others move in and out multiple
times.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Current Statistics on Young Adults Living at Home (U.S.
Census Bureau, 2011b):</strong>
<ul>
<li>59% of men and 50% of women (ages 18-24) live with parents.<br />
</li>
<li>19% of men and 10% of women (ages 25-34) live with parents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reasons for Staying in the Parental Home Longer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>High youth unemployment and economic instability.<br />
</li>
<li>Increased education requirements and student debt.<br />
</li>
<li>High housing costs and preference for local colleges.<br />
</li>
<li>More affluent parents with larger homes and fewer children.<br />
</li>
<li>Later marriage trends and cultural expectations in immigrant
families.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gender Differences in Leaving Home:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Men stay home longer than women due to age gaps in
relationships.<br />
</li>
<li>Parents may be more lenient with sons and expect less household
responsibility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Boomerang Kids:</strong>
<ul>
<li>About 50% of young adults who move out return at some point.<br />
</li>
<li>More likely to return if they moved out at a younger age.<br />
</li>
<li>Common reasons: job loss, financial struggles, breakups, or family
needs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Changing Social Norms and Cultural Influence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>“Normal” moving-out age varies by culture and historical
period.<br />
</li>
<li>In Europe, late leavers show higher solidarity with parents.<br />
</li>
<li>Late leavers live closer, stay in frequent contact, and
provide/receive more support.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Transition to Adulthood in Different Cultures:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some young adults face cultural shifts (e.g., American Indian
students at state universities).<br />
</li>
<li>Rural youth in developing countries may struggle with new urban
values and norms.<br />
</li>
<li>Some emerging adults migrate for greater independence and
opportunities.</li>

<h5>Becoming a Spouse or Partner</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marriage Trends in the U.S.:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Marriage remains traditional but is declining in prevalence.<br />
</li>
<li>Average age of first marriage: 26 for women, 28 for men.<br />
</li>
<li>Marriage age has increased by ~3 years over the last three
decades.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reasons for Delayed Marriage:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Desire for a higher standard of living before marriage.<br />
</li>
<li>Reduced societal pressure to marry for sex or children.<br />
</li>
<li>Increase in cohabitation as an alternative or precursor to
marriage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rise of Cohabitation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>11% of young, opposite-sex couples currently cohabit.<br />
</li>
<li>Most couples today live together before marriage.<br />
</li>
<li>Cohabitation rates vary globally due to cultural, economic, and
legal factors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Types of Cohabitation:</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Alternative to marriage</strong> – Long-term cohabitation
with no plans to marry (common in Sweden, France, Denmark).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Prelude to marriage</strong> – Living together before
eventual marriage (common in Switzerland, Finland).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Alternative to being single</strong> – Short-term
cohabitation without marriage plans (common in the U.S., New
Zealand).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Marriage Stability and Longevity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite a high divorce rate, newer marriages last longer than past
ones.<br />
</li>
<li>21% of married individuals are in second or third marriages.<br />
</li>
<li>Over 33% of all married couples celebrate their 25th
anniversary.<br />
</li>
<li>6% of couples reach their 50th anniversary.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="gender-roles-in-early-partnerships" class="section level5">
<h5>Gender Roles in Early Partnerships</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact of Marriage or Cohabitation:</strong> Significant
life changes, especially in gender roles, where early
marriages/partnerships tend to be more egalitarian.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Household Chores and Gender Roles:</strong> Tasks are often
divided along traditional gender lines, where women do more cooking and
cleaning, while men handle yard work and repairs.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Workload Differences:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Single women: 13 hours of housework per week.<br />
</li>
<li>Single men: 9 hours of housework per week.<br />
</li>
<li>Married women: 17 hours per week.<br />
</li>
<li>Married men: 14 hours per week.<br />
</li>
<li>Marriage increases housework for both partners, but women still do
more overall.</li>

</div>
<div id="marital-status-and-health" class="section level5">
<h5>**Marital Status and Health</h5>
<p><strong>Marriage and Health Benefits</strong><br />
- Married individuals tend to have better mental and physical health
than unmarried individuals across various racial and ethnic
groups.<br />
- Studies across cultures confirm these health benefits.<br />
- Married people live longer than divorced, widowed, or never-married
individuals.<br />
- Cohabiting couples (both same-sex and different-sex) show similar
health benefits to married couples, though same-sex cohabiting couples
report slightly poorer health than different-sex married couples.</p>
<p><strong>Explanations for Health Differences</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Marital Selection Effect</strong>: Healthier individuals are
more likely to get married, partially explaining the difference in
health between married and unmarried individuals.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Marital Resources Effect</strong>: Marriage provides
financial security, social support, and promotes healthier
lifestyles.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Marital Crisis Effect</strong>: The health decline is linked
more to the stress of divorce or widowhood than to marriage itself, with
those who remain unmarried throughout life report similar health levels
to those in stable marriages.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Marriage Stability vs. Marriage Happiness</strong><br />
- Simply staying married does not guarantee health benefits.<br />
- Unhappily married individuals report more health issues than happily
married ones.<br />
- A study showed that those who stayed in unhappy marriages had worse
physical and mental health than those who divorced and either remarried
happily or remained single.<br />
- Excessive stress in relationships is linked to heart disease and other
health problems.</p>
<p><strong>Conflict and Health Risks</strong><br />
- Marital discord, especially with hostility, is linked to
increased:<br />
- Heart rate and blood pressure<br />
- Muscular reactivity<br />
- Negative endocrine and immune responses<br />
- A direct risk factor for poor health.</p>
</div>
<div id="becoming-a-parent" class="section level5">
<h5>Becoming a Parent</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>About 85% of U.S. adults will eventually become parents, usually
in their 20s or 30s, bringing satisfaction, self-worth, and a sense of
adulthood but also involves major life changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delayed Parenthood Trends</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Young adults are delaying parenthood, with teen and emerging adult
childbirth rates in decline.<br />
</li>
<li>Declines in teen pregnancy, abortions, and foetal loss are linked to
contraception use and pregnancy prevention efforts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Increasing Births Among Older Women</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More women over 40 are having children due to delayed childbirth,
fertility advancements, and societal acceptance of single
motherhood.<br />
</li>
<li>Over 500 births per year are to women over 50.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Rising Average Age of First-Time Mothers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The average age for a first birth in the U.S. is now 25.4 years, an
increase of almost 4 years over 30 years.<br />
</li>
<li>Most developed countries show similar trends, with an average first
birth age of nearly 28 years.<br />
</li>
<li>The U.S. has one of the lowest average first birth ages among
developed nations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Increase in Non-Marital Births</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>41% of births in the U.S. are to unmarried parents.<br />
</li>
<li>This trend peaked in 2008 but has since declined.<br />
</li>
<li>58% of non-marital births are to cohabiting couples, challenging the
stereotype of single, young unwed mothers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Gender Role Shifts After Having Children</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Couples tend to shift toward more traditional gender roles after
having children.<br />
</li>
<li>Anthropologist David Guttmann calls this the <strong>parental
imperative</strong>, suggesting it is biologically wired.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Parental investment theory</strong> states that women invest
more time and resources in child-rearing, leading to distinct gender
roles.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Economic exchange theory</strong> suggests that women
provide childbearing abilities, while men take on financial
responsibility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Work and Parenting Responsibilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fathers work more hours after becoming parents, while mothers work
fewer.<br />
</li>
<li>Despite this, gender differences in work and childcare are
decreasing.<br />
</li>
<li>Mothers with children under 18 typically work full-time and spend
<strong>12 hours per week</strong> on child-related activities, while
fathers spend <strong>8.4 hours</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Mothers spend <strong>24 hours per week</strong> on housework, while
fathers report <strong>20 hours</strong>; however, fathers spend more
time on home maintenance and repairs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Lesbian and Adoptive Parents’ Division of
Labor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In lesbian couples, housework is equally shared, but the biological
mother takes on more childcare, while the nonbiological mother works
more.<br />
</li>
<li>Among adoptive parents (gay, lesbian, and heterosexual), the parent
who works more hours outside the home does less childcare.<br />
</li>
<li>The parent contributing the most income does less housework.<br />
</li>
<li>Same-sex couples share household tasks more equally than
heterosexual couples.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Changing Gender Roles Over Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The gender gap in household chores has been decreasing over
generations.<br />
</li>
<li>Boys raised in families with working mothers are more likely to
share household duties in adulthood.<br />
</li>
<li>Girls raised in such households develop egalitarian expectations in
relationships.<br />
</li>
<li>Increased female workforce participation has led to more power in
relationships and greater cooperation from male partners in childcare
and household tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Gender Roles among Couples with Children</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional Gender Role Shift</strong> – Couples adopt more
traditional roles after marriage and especially after having children,
influenced by biological and evolutionary factors.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Theoretical Explanations</strong> – <strong>Parental
Investment Theory</strong> links caregiving to biological differences,
while <strong>Economic Exchange Theory</strong> sees men as financial
providers and women as caregivers.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Work &amp; Household Division</strong> – Fathers work more
after having children, while mothers work less and handle more childcare
and housework, though the gap is narrowing.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Same-Sex &amp; Adoptive Parents</strong> – Housework is
shared more equally, but the partner working more outside does less
childcare, regardless of gender.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Changing Trends</strong> – More working mothers lead to
greater gender equality in housework and parenting over time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Parenthood and Marital Happiness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marital Satisfaction &amp; Parenthood</strong> – Unlike
marriage, which increases happiness, becoming parents often leads to a
decline in marital satisfaction, following a curvilinear pattern—highest
before the first child and after children leave home.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Predictors of Marital Happiness</strong> – Couples with
strong marital friendship, expressed through fondness, admiration, and
awareness of each other, maintain or improve their happiness despite the
challenges of parenthood.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Role of Husbands</strong> – A husband’s positivity and
attentiveness toward his wife early on predicts whether her marital
happiness will decline after childbirth.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Young Adulthood as a Time of Transition</strong> –
Parenthood is one of many complex life transitions in young adulthood,
but resilience and support can ease the adjustment.</li>

roles transitions and changes that are typical in middle adulthood.</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Role Transitions in Middle Adulthood</strong>
<ul>
<li>Existing roles (parent, worker, spouse, child) evolve rather than
disappear.<br />
</li>
<li>Parenting becomes less demanding, marriage satisfaction often
increases, and careers stabilize.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Empty Nest and Its Effects</strong>
<ul>
<li>Contrary to stereotypes, the empty nest phase is generally
positive.<br />
</li>
<li>Many couples experience a “second honeymoon,” and women often
explore new careers or interests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gender Role Changes in Midlife</strong>
<ul>
<li>Traditional gender roles shift, with women becoming more assertive
and men developing more communal qualities.<br />
</li>
<li>This change is more of an <strong>expansion</strong> of roles rather
than a complete reversal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Role of Grandparenting</strong>
<ul>
<li>More people are grandparents than ever before, with an increasing
lifespan allowing for longer involvement.<br />
</li>
<li>Grandparents are active in their grandchildren’s lives, providing
financial and emotional support.<br />
</li>
<li>Differences exist based on proximity, gender (maternal grandmothers
are often more involved), and family dynamics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Grandparents Raising Grandchildren</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some grandparents take on parental responsibilities due to the
parents’ inability to do so.<br />
</li>
<li>Financial and legal challenges arise for these “grandfamilies,”
often with little government assistance.<br />
</li>
<li>Grandfathers in this role often work full-time and experience
different stresses compared to grandmothers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ethnic and Racial Differences in Midlife
Experiences</strong>
<ul>
<li>Racial and ethnic minorities often face greater health challenges
but report higher psychological well-being.<br />
</li>
<li>Life expectancy disparities affect the experience of midlife across
different racial groups.</li>

<h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Explain the positive and negative
impact of caregiving for a relative during middle adulthood</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevalence of Caregiving</strong> – Many middle-aged adults
care for aging parents, especially as fewer parents remain in good
health. Adult children take on caregiving when a spouse is
unavailable.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Gender and Caregiving</strong> – Traditionally, daughters
and daughters-in-law have provided care, but more men are now involved
due to women’s increased workforce participation.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Shared Caregiving Responsibilities</strong> – Caregiving
often involves multiple family members, professional caregivers, and
community support, rather than a single individual.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Changing Caregiving Roles</strong> – Baby boomers have more
siblings to share caregiving tasks, but parents often prefer care from
the child they feel closest to, usually a daughter.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Parent-Child Relationships &amp; Caregiving</strong> –
Middle-aged adults are more likely to care for parents they are
emotionally close to, with divorced fathers often receiving less
support.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Caregiving</strong> – Caregivers, especially those
caring for parents with dementia, experience <strong>caregiver
burden</strong>, leading to increased stress, depression, lower marital
satisfaction, and poorer physical health. However, those with strong
social support, a good marriage, and job satisfaction tend to manage
caregiving more effectively and experience less stress.</li>

<li><p><strong>Living Alone</strong> – Many older adults, especially
women, experience living alone due to widowhood or divorce. While some
manage with strong family and community support, others face challenges
in adjusting to this transition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Desire for Independence</strong> – Older adults highly
value their independence, preferring to live on their own when possible.
Even when they require assistance, they want to maintain control over
their daily lives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Becoming a Care Receiver</strong> – While many older
adults have spent years caring for others, some eventually require care
themselves. This shift is often difficult, as it can involve a loss of
autonomy and privacy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenges of Residential Care</strong> – Older adults in
care facilities often struggle with loss of privacy, freedom, and
personal space. Adjusting successfully requires acceptance and finding
ways to maintain independence within structured environments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Effects of Caregiving on Older Adults</strong> – While
family caregiving has benefits, it can also have unintended negative
effects. Overprotective caregiving can lead to a loss of confidence and
increased dependence in older adults.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Importance of Personalized Care</strong> – Caregiving
should be tailored to the recipient’s actual needs. Studies suggest that
misjudging the level of care needed—whether overestimating or
underestimating pain and abilities—can lead to dissatisfaction and
stress for both caregivers and recipients.</p></li>

class="section level4 alert alert-info">
<h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Note the effects of not
undertaking typical social roles, or undertaking roles at atypical
times.</h4>
<p><strong>Social Roles in Atypical Families</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Changing Family Structures</strong> – Traditional family
models no longer represent the majority. More people live in
single-person households, as single parents, or in nontraditional
partnerships.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Lifelong Singles</strong> – A significant portion of adults
remain single for life. While they may worry about aging without
support, research suggests they develop strong networks of friends and
extended family.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Childlessness</strong> – The rate of childlessness is
rising, particularly among highly educated women. Childless adults often
have fulfilling careers and strong social networks, challenging the
assumption that they lack support in old age.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Divorce and Remarriage</strong> – Many marriages end in
divorce, leading to role changes, single parenthood, and economic
challenges. Remarriage brings new roles, including that of stepparent,
which comes with unique emotional and social complexities.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Step-parenting Challenges</strong> – Stepmothers, in
particular, face difficulties balancing their role within the family.
Society’s perception of stepmothers, along with ambiguous expectations,
adds to their challenges.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Economic Impact of Divorce</strong> – Divorce often leads to
financial hardship, which affects both parents and children. Economic
strain is a major factor in the negative effects of divorce.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Undertaking Roles at Atypical Times</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Social Timing and Role Transitions</strong> – Social timing
refers to when and how individuals assume life roles based on cultural
expectations. Being “on-time” or “off-time” can influence personal
well-being and social development.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Social Clock Theory</strong> – The concept that people have
an internalised timeline for life events (e.g., marriage, parenthood,
career milestones) based on societal norms. Falling out of sync with
this timeline can lead to stress or social disapproval.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Cultural and Personal Differences in Life Events</strong> –
What is considered “on-time” in one culture or era may be “off-time” in
another. Norms evolve over time and vary across different
societies.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Off-Time Events</strong> – Experiencing life
events at unexpected times (e.g., young widowhood, raising grandchildren
in old age) can create challenges and affect life satisfaction.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Life Course Patterns</strong> – Despite individual
variations, most adults follow a broad pattern of role transitions:
increasing roles in early adulthood, role renegotiation in middle
adulthood, and further transitions in late adulthood.</li>

<p><strong>Describe Holland’s six types of vocational
interests.</strong> </br></p>
<p><img src="images/HPS302/Week3/Holland.jpg" /></p>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong>Explain Marcia’s theory of career selection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marcia’s Career Identity Theory</strong> – Developmental
psychologist James E. Marcia expanded Erikson’s theory of identity
development by identifying four stages of career identity formation:
<ul>
<li><strong>Diffusion</strong>: No career decision, no
exploration.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Foreclosure</strong>: Career chosen without exploration,
often based on parental expectations.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Moratorium</strong>: Active career exploration without
commitment.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Achievement</strong>: Career commitment after
exploration.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Extended Career Exploration</strong> – The stage of
<strong>moratorium</strong> has lengthened in modern society, with full
career identity achievement often not occurring until around age 30
(Arnett, 2004).</li>
<li><strong>Career Transitions Beyond Young Adulthood</strong> – Career
changes are not limited to emerging adulthood. Many adults switch
careers, move between full-time and part-time work, or face job loss and
career shifts throughout life.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Challenges and Mental Health Implications</strong> – Career
changes, whether voluntary or involuntary, can be stressful and impact
mental health. Vocational and clinical psychologists play a crucial role
in helping individuals navigate these transitions (Fouad &amp; Bynner,
2008).</li>

class="section level5 alert alert-info">
<h5><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Explain the impact of work on
caring for adult family members</h5>
<ul>
<li>Many working adults balance careers with caregiving for adult family
members (elderly parents, ill spouses, or disabled relatives).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Statistics (National Alliance for Caregiving &amp; AARP,
2009)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>29% of U.S. adults provide care for at least one adult family
member.<br />
</li>
<li>20% of caregivers provide over 40 hours of care per week.<br />
</li>
<li>60% of caregivers also work full-time.<br />
</li>
<li>40% of caregivers are men, though women provide more hours and
hands-on care.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Economic Impact on Caregivers</strong>:
<ul>
<li>43% experienced reduced work hours or salaries.<br />
</li>
<li>16% lost jobs or were laid off.<br />
</li>
<li>33% took second jobs to cover caregiving costs.<br />
</li>
<li>Many reduced retirement savings (60%), used savings (43%), or
increased debt (43%).<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emotional &amp; Psychological Impact</strong>:
<ul>
<li>“Extreme caregivers” (dual-earner couples caring for children and
adults) make up 10% of the population, a growing number.<br />
</li>
<li>Surprisingly, those with heavier caregiving loads had lower
depression and higher life satisfaction.<br />
</li>
<li>Caregiving can strengthen family bonds and improve coping
skills.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Workplace Support Needed</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Employers should implement family-friendly policies: flex-time,
remote work, job sharing, counselling, and dependent-care accounts.</li>

<h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Outline different reasons people
might retire, and the various effects that retirement might have on a
person.</h4>
<div id="reasons-for-retirement" class="section level5">
<h5>Reasons For Retirement</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Involuntary vs. Voluntary Retirement</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some workers retire due to layoffs, mergers, or difficulty finding
new employment.<br />
</li>
<li>Others choose retirement based on personal and financial
factors.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Financial Factors</strong>
<ul>
<li>The decision to retire depends on comparing work-related benefits
(salary, pension growth, Social Security increases, health insurance)
vs. retirement-related value (savings, investments, home equity,
pensions, Social Security).<br />
</li>
<li>Economic downturns (e.g., 2008 financial crisis) led some to delay
retirement.<br />
</li>
<li>Medicare availability at 65 affects healthcare cost
considerations.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Health Considerations</strong>
<ul>
<li>Poor health can push workers into early retirement, especially in
physically demanding jobs.<br />
</li>
<li>Conversely, high medical costs may encourage staying employed for
insurance benefits.<br />
</li>
<li>Caregiving responsibilities for a spouse or family member can lead
to retirement (3% retire early due to caregiving).<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Family Responsibilities</strong>
<ul>
<li>Late parenthood or supporting children’s education can delay
retirement.<br />
</li>
<li>Grandparents raising grandchildren may postpone retirement for
financial stability.<br />
</li>
<li>Many women retire early due to their husbands’ retirement, though
some feel pressured into it.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Career Commitment</strong>
<ul>
<li>Workers highly committed to their careers (especially the
self-employed) tend to retire later.<br />
</li>
<li>Those with job dissatisfaction or low attachment to their company
retire earlier.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Leisure &amp; Personal Interests</strong>
<ul>
<li>People with strong hobbies, travel interests, and social activities
often retire earlier.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="effects-of-retirement" class="section level5">
<h5>Effects of Retirement</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimal Lifestyle Impact</strong>
<ul>
<li>Retirement does not drastically change health, activity levels, or
attitudes for most retirees.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Changes in Income</strong>
<ul>
<li>Social Security is the primary income source for retirees (37% of
average income).<br />
</li>
<li>Other sources include earnings, pensions, and asset income (stocks,
savings, rental properties).<br />
</li>
<li>Income typically drops after retirement, but reduced expenses (e.g.,
mortgage-free homes, Medicare eligibility) help maintain financial
stability.<br />
</li>
<li>Some retirees actually see an income increase due to Social Security
benefits.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Poverty and Gender Disparities</strong>
<ul>
<li>Poverty among retirees has declined (from 28.5% in 1966 to 9% in
2010), but many are still “near poor.”<br />
</li>
<li>Women, particularly widows and minorities, are more likely to
experience financial hardship due to lower lifetime earnings and reduced
pensions.<br />
</li>
<li>The “feminization of poverty” is driven by factors such as
widowhood, career interruptions, and lower wages.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Changes in Residence</strong>
<ul>
<li>20% of people over 55 moved between 1995 and 2000, mostly within the
same county.<br />
</li>
<li>Only about 4% moved out of state, with Florida, Arizona, and Nevada
being top destinations.<br />
</li>
<li>Three main types of retirement moves:
<ul>
<li><strong>Amenity Moves</strong> – Relocating to warmer climates for a
better lifestyle.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Kinship Moves</strong> – Moving closer to family for
support.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Institutional Moves</strong> – Transitioning to assisted
living or nursing homes.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Seasonal migration (“snowbirds”) is common among retirees, but most
return home permanently as they age.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="explain-the-potential-impact-of-retirement-on-women."
class="section level5 alert alert-info">
<h5><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Explain the potential impact of
retirement on women.</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Risk of Poverty</strong>
<ul>
<li>Women are twice as likely as men to experience poverty in
retirement.<br />
</li>
<li>The “feminization of poverty” means older women, especially widows
and minorities, are disproportionately affected.<br />
</li>
<li>Black and Hispanic elderly women, particularly those living alone,
face the highest poverty rates (43% below the poverty line, 54%
near-poor).<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reduced Lifetime Earnings and Pensions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many women earned lower wages throughout their careers, limiting
their retirement savings.<br />
</li>
<li>Career interruptions for child-rearing and caregiving reduce
eligibility for pensions and Social Security benefits.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On average, women receive only 40% of the pension benefits that men
receive.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Financial Impact of Widowhood</strong><br />
</li>
<li>Upon a husband’s death, women receive either their own Social
Security benefits or 100% of their husband’s—but not both.<br />
</li>
<li>This leads to a significant drop in household income (typically
between 50–67%), while many fixed expenses (housing, taxes) remain
unchanged.<br />
</li>
<li>Nearly two-thirds of the elderly poor are women due to this income
reduction.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Private Pensions and Savings</strong><br />
</li>
<li>Many women of older generations did not have access to
employer-sponsored pension plans.<br />
</li>
<li>Those who did work often had part-time or lower-paying jobs without
retirement benefits.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Dependency on Spousal Income</strong><br />
</li>
<li>Many married women rely on their husband’s income during
retirement.<br />
</li>
<li>However, almost half of women retire as widowed, divorced, or never
married, meaning they cannot depend on shared resources.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Future Generations and Potential Improvements</strong><br />
</li>
<li>Younger women are more likely to have worked consistently and
contributed to retirement savings.<br />
</li>
<li>However, without systemic changes like improved family leave
policies or caregiving support, gender-based retirement inequalities may
persist.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="describe-the-alternatives-to-retirement."
class="section level5 alert alert-info">
<h5><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Describe the alternatives to
retirement.</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shunning Retirement</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some individuals enjoy their work and plan to continue beyond
traditional retirement age, even if financially secure.<br />
</li>
<li>This is common among highly educated professionals (e.g., academics,
researchers) whose careers are deeply integrated with their personal
lives.<br />
</li>
<li>Conversely, lower-income workers may continue working due to
financial necessity, lacking sufficient pensions or savings.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Returning to the Workforce</strong>
<ul>
<li>Around 25% of retirees reenter the labor market, sometimes in
different roles or with new employers.<br />
</li>
<li>Reasons for returning include financial need, loneliness,
restlessness, or a desire for purpose.<br />
</li>
<li>Some retirees attempt retirement multiple times before settling into
it.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gradual Retirement &amp; Bridge Jobs</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many retirees transition to part-time or less stressful jobs after
leaving their primary careers.<br />
</li>
<li>Bridge jobs are common in professions with early retirement options
(e.g., police officers becoming security guards, military veterans
moving into administrative roles).<br />
</li>
<li>Self-employment is also a popular option, allowing retirees to turn
hobbies into income sources.<br />
</li>
<li>While bridge jobs provide flexibility and engagement, they often
come with lower pay and fewer benefits.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Volunteer Work</strong>
<ul>
<li>Over a quarter of adults aged 55+ engage in volunteer
activities.<br />
</li>
<li>Programs like the Foster Grandparents Program and Senior Companion
Program provide meaningful roles for retirees.<br />
</li>
<li>Studies show that volunteering enhances happiness, life
satisfaction, self-esteem, and physical health, making it a beneficial
alternative to full retirement.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Phased Retirement</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some employers offer phased retirement, allowing older workers to
gradually reduce their workload instead of stopping abruptly.<br />
</li>
<li>This approach is more common in Japan and Europe but is slowly
gaining traction in the U.S.<br />
</li>
<li>Benefits include maintaining an income, staying socially connected,
and mentoring younger employees.</li>
