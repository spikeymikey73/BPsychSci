<p><strong>Evaluation of Psychosocial Theory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While insightful and plausible, no empirical evidence was gathered
to develop theory.</li>
<li>Erikson worked mainly with children, so his theory was based on this
experience.</li>
<li>The teen crisis was used to refer to the sensitivity of
developmental meds at each stage, rather than a catastrophic event.</li>
<li>Emphasises the role of psychological and social influence a
development throughout a lifetime.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="behaviourism" class="section level3">
<h3>Behaviourism</h3>
<p>Watson (1913) coined the term ‘behaviourism’, which is a theory
assuming that behaviour is observable and can be traced back to other
observable events. The goal of Behaviourism is to explain relationships
between stimuli, responses and consequences.</p>
<p>Identified by many as being relevant regardless of age, and not being
isolated to a particular “stage”. The focus instead, is on
stimulus/response and looking for predictable patterns of behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The Blank Slate: Children enter the world as a blank slate with
ability to learn based on their environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Behavioural Focus: Concentrates on observable behaviours, and
discovery of environmental stimuli responsible.</p></li>
<li><p>Environmental Determinism: A individuals behaviour is shaped by
their environment rather than ‘free will’.</p></li>
<li><p>Conditioning: The main process through which we learn.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of behaviourism include: Pavlov’s dogs (Classical
Conditioning), Skinner’s Pigeons (Operant Conditioning) and Bandura’s
Social Modelling or Social learning theory (Bobo Doll). The observation
(of consequences), imitation, and modelling as demonstrated via the Bobo
doll experiment (modelling and imitation of aggression). The experiment
found that observations of aggressive behaviour influenced children
towards acceptance of behaviours.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of behavioural theories</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Empirical approach</li>
<li>Attempts to demonstrate cause and effect</li>
<li>Neglects rational thought processes.</li>
<li>Does not address behaviours that are present in the absence of
conditioning.</li>
<li>Demonstration of hostile more likely to develop a hostile bias in
future interactions.</li>
<li>Some suggest that the setting is artificial. Demonstrating
behaviours that were thought to be expected.</li>
<li>Fails to determine if behaviours would be generalised in other
scenarios.</li>
<li>Primary focus on environmental factors, ignoring genetic
disposition, sex based neurological differences.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="ethological-theory" class="section level3">
<h3>Ethological Theory</h3>
<p>(Darwin, Tinbergen, Burkhardt, Lorenz, Hinde, Ramey &amp; Ramey)</p>
<p>Stresses that behaviour is strongly influenced by biology and
evolution while also being mediated by sensitive periods. Emotions and
thinking are heavily influenced by inherited factors. Charles Darwin’s
theory of evolution underpins this theory, stating that more than just
physical attributes (hair and eye colour) influence us.</p>
<p>Also Posits that the selective pressures of an environment govern the
development of the individual’s traits and behaviour, rather than
genetic make up. With a basis in Darwin’s theory of natural selection,
this theory originates in the observation of animals in their natural
habitat rather than a lab. Others (Lorenz) in this field observed a
critical period of development characterised by
<strong>imprinting</strong> in animals, adapted to be known as a
<strong>sensitive period</strong> in humans.</p>
</div>
<div id="bioecological-theory-bronfenbrenner" class="section level3">
<h3>Bioecological Theory (Bronfenbrenner)</h3>
<p>The Bioecological model focusses on individual development within a
set of overlapping ecological systems. These systems influence the
individual together as he/she develops.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Microsystem: Immediate social groups such as family, school, work
and peers.</li>
<li>Mesosystem: The connection/interaction of 2 micro systems
(parent/teacher interviews, birthday party, etc..)</li>
<li>Exosystem: Systems not requiring direct involvement which still
exert an influence on the individual, such as newspapers, media,
TV.</li>
<li>Macrosystem: Overarching systems which govern day to day lives, such
as local council, state government, economy, culture.</li>
</ol>
<p>The later addition of the Chronosystem addressed the influence of
time to both historical events (war, recession, etc.) and the timing of
life events (puberty, having children, getting married)</p>

<p>Four key concepts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Human lives situated in historical time and place</em>

development of individuals across differing birth cohorts in a similar
way.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Developmental Studies must pay attention to the time of our

<li>Social roles and events can define our behaviours based on the
period of our lives in which they occur. (e.g. teen mum vs 30 something

<h2 class="well">Topic 2: Personality</h2>
<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>The psychodynamic perspective on personality, originated from the
work of Sigmund Freud, emphasizes unconscious psychological processes
(such as wishes and fears) and the impact of childhood experiences on
adult personality.</li>
<li>This perspective has been both influential and controversial, with
some of its concepts being supported by empirical evidence while others
are not.</li>
<li>The psychodynamic theory continues to play an important role in
psychology and many related disciplines, such as developmental
psychology, social psychology, sociology, and neuroscience.</li>
<li>The theory has evolved over time and now includes innovative
approaches such as object relations theory and neuropsychoanalysis.</li>
<li>In the context of personality, psychodynamic theory can help one
understand why they may do things that don’t make sense, by exploring
unconscious thoughts and emotions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="core-assumptions-of-the-psychodynamic-perspective"
class="section level3 tabset">
<h3 class="tabset">Core Assumptions of the Psychodynamic
Perspective</h3>
<p>The core assumptions of the psychodynamic framework are unique from
the components of other personality ideas.</p>
<div id="primacy-of-the-unconscious" class="section level4">
<h4>1. Primacy of the Unconscious</h4>
<ul>
<li>The perspective on unconscious psychological processes is a central
aspect of psychodynamic theory.</li>
<li>The idea is that unconscious thoughts, feelings, and impulses
influence our behaviour, even though we may not be aware of them.</li>
<li>For example, a person may have unconscious fears or desires that
drive their behaviour, even if they don’t consciously understand what is
motivating them.</li>
<li>Psychoanalytic therapy aims to bring these unconscious processes to
consciousness, where they can be better understood and addressed.</li>
<li>The belief in the importance of unconscious psychological processes
continues to be a defining feature of the psychodynamic perspective on
personality.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="critical-importance-of-early-experiences"
class="section level4">
<h4>2. Critical Importance of Early Experiences</h4>
<ul>
<li>The psychodynamic theory holds that childhood experiences and
unconscious psychological processes play a crucial role in shaping adult
personality.</li>
<li>According to this perspective, early childhood experiences,
including even those that occur in the first few weeks or months of
life, can have a lasting impact on a person’s personality development
and dynamics.</li>
<li>The emphasis on early childhood events sets the psychodynamic theory
apart from other models of personality development, which also consider
early experiences but do not place as much emphasis on their
impact.</li>
<li>The theory also posits that experiences outside the normal range,
such as the loss of a parent or sibling at an early age, can have a
particularly strong impact on personality development.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="psychic-causality" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">3. Psychic Causality</h4>
<ul>
<li>The third core assumption of psychodynamic theory is that nothing in
mental life happens by chance—that there is no such thing as a random
thought, feeling, motive, or behaviour.</li>
<li>This has come to be known as the <em>principle of psychic
causality</em>, and though few psychologists accept the principle of
psychic causality precisely as psychoanalysts conceive it, most
theorists and researchers agree that thoughts, motives, emotional
responses, and expressed behaviours do not arise randomly, but always
stem from some combination of identifiable biological and psychological
processes (Elliott, 2002; Robinson &amp; Gordon, 2011).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-evolution-of-psychodynamic-theory"
class="section level3 tabset">
<h3 class="tabset">The Evolution of Psychodynamic Theory</h3>
<ul>
<li>Freud’s background in neurology is the basis for the first
incarnation of psychoanalytic theory being regarded as primarily
biological.</li>
<li>Freud set out to explain psychological phenomena in terms that could
be linked to neurological functioning as it was understood in his
day.</li>
<li>Because Freud’s work in this area evolved over more than 50 years
(he began in 1885, and continued until he died in 1939), there were
numerous revisions along the way.</li>
<li>Thus, it is most accurate to think of psychodynamic theory as a set
of interrelated models that complement and build upon each other.</li>
<li>Three are particularly important: the topographic model, the
psychosexual stage model, and the structural model.</li>
</ul>
<div id="the-topographic-model" class="section level4">
<h4>The Topographic Model</h4>
<ul>
<li>The topographic model describes the unconscious, preconscious, and
conscious as different regions of the mind.</li>
<li>The unconscious is seen as the largest (and most primitive, and
controversial) part of the psyche, contains all the instinctual drives,
repressed material, and anxiety-producing material (such as sexual
impulses and aggressive urges) that are deliberately repressed, meaning
they are kept outside of conscious awareness as a form of self-defence
because they make you uncomfortable.</li>
<li>The preconscious is a more advanced part of the mind, which contains
thoughts and feelings that are not currently in conscious awareness but
can be brought to consciousness if needed.</li>
<li>The conscious is the smallest part of the mind and contains all the
thoughts, feelings, and experiences that are currently in
awareness.</li>
<li>The idea of the unconscious mind continues to be debated in
psychology, with some researchers finding evidence for its existence and
others believing that unconscious processing can be explained without
it.</li>
<li>The terms conscious, preconscious, and unconscious continue to be
used today and research has provided some support for Freud’s thoughts
regarding conscious and preconscious processing.</li>
<li>However, the idea of a Freudian unconscious repository of repressed

<div id="the-psychosexual-stage-model" class="section level4">
<h4>The Psychosexual Stage Model</h4>
<ul>
<li>The psychosexual stage model proposed by Freud in 1905 argues that
human personality development progresses through a sequence of stages
(driven by sexual and aggressive energy (libido)), each with its own
unique challenge and mode of sexual gratification from infancy to
adulthood.</li>
<li>The stages are oral, anal, Oedipal, latency, and genital. Fixation
at a particular stage due to frustration or over gratification is
thought to result in a dependent (oral), controlling (anal), or
aggressive/competitive (Oedipal) personality style.</li>
<li>Each stage is marked by the appearance of a new erogenous zone (an
area of the body that is particularly sensitive to sexual stimulation)
and is associated with a specific conflict that must be resolved.</li>
<li>According to the model, if the individual experiences trauma or
fixates at any of the stages, this can result in the development of
certain personality traits and psychological disorders.</li>
<li>The psychosexual stage model and its relationship to personality
development remain a significant part of psychoanalytic theory.</li>

<div id="the-structural-model" class="section level4">
<h4>The Structural Model</h4>
<ul>
<li>The structural model describes the psyche as consisting of three
parts: the id, the ego, and the superego.</li>
<li>The id is the unconscious part of the psyche that is driven by
instinctual drives and impulses.</li>
<li>The ego is the conscious part of the psyche that mediates between
the impulses of the id and the demands of reality.</li>
<li>The superego is the moral component of the psyche, which
internalizes the values and norms of society and provides a sense of
right and wrong.</li>
<li>According to the structural model, the dynamic interplay between the
id, ego, and superego results in the development of the individual’s
personality and behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="the-ego-and-its-defences" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered">The Ego and its Defences</h4>
<p>Common Ego Defences in Psychodynamic Theory</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repression</strong>: The unconscious removal of upsetting
thoughts and feelings from conscious awareness. Example: A person blocks
out memories of childhood abuse.</li>
<li><strong>Denial</strong>: The conscious ignoring the implications of
a painful event. Example: A person with a substance abuse problem says
“I’m fine—even though people complain about my drinking, I never miss a
day of work.”</li>
<li><strong>Projection</strong>: Attributing one’s own unacceptable
thoughts or feelings to others. Example: A person who has aggressive
impulses accuses others of being hostile.</li>
<li><strong>Displacement</strong>: Shifting one’s emotional responses
from a threatening target to a less threatening substitute. Example: A
person who is angry with their boss takes out their frustration on their
spouse.</li>
<li><strong>Regression</strong>: Reverting to an earlier stage of
development in response to stress. Example: An adult who is feeling
overwhelmed may start sucking their thumb.</li>
<li><strong>Rationalization</strong>: Offering self-justifying
explanations in place of the real reasons for one’s behavior. Example: A
person who was fired for poor performance says that the job wasn’t a
good fit for them anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Sublimation</strong>: Channelling unacceptable impulses into
socially acceptable behavior. Example: A person who has aggressive
impulses becomes a professional boxer.</li>
<li>These are just a few of the many ego defenses that have been
identified in psychodynamic theory. The use of these defences is seen as
a way for the ego to manage anxiety and protect itself from stress, but
at the same time, they can also lead to the distorting of reality and
the perpetuation of problematic behavior patterns.</li>

<div
id="object-relations-theory-and-the-growth-of-the-psychodynamic-perspective"
class="section level4">
<h4>Object Relations Theory and the Growth of the Psychodynamic
Perspective</h4>
<ul>
<li>This perspective focuses on the role of early childhood
relationships in shaping personality and shaping adult relationships. It
emphasizes the importance of the child’s experience of being loved,
understood and emotionally connected to important caretakers.</li>
<li>According to this theory, a child’s relationship with his or her
parents is crucial to the formation of self-esteem and the capacity for
healthy relationships in adulthood.</li>
<li>The child’s interactions with his or her parents and other
significant figures are seen as the building blocks of the child’s inner
world, including mental representations of self and others, as well as
unconscious fantasies, desires, and anxieties.</li>
<li>Also emphasizes the importance of the interpersonal context in
shaping personality development. This means that relationships, rather
than individual factors, are seen as the key drivers of personality
development and change.</li>
<li>Overall, object relations theory offers a nuanced and sophisticated
perspective on the development of personality, recognizing the
importance of both early childhood experiences and ongoing relationships

<li>This research has provided some support for psychodynamic concepts,

<li>Psychoanalysis and culture is another growing area of interest in
contemporary psychodynamic theory.</li>
<li>Psychoanalysis has always been concerned with the role of culture in
shaping personality, but it has historically focused on the influence of
the cultural forces (such as media, religion, politics, and economics)
that shape our unconscious desires and conflicts.</li>
<li>Today, psychoanalytic research also considers the ways in which
culture shapes the way we understand and treat mental illness.</li>
<li>In particular, researchers are exploring how cultural and ethnic
differences affect the way people experience and express emotions,
relationships, and psychological distress.</li>
<li>Advances in neuroscience have created new opportunities and
challenges for psychodynamic theory. The increasing ability to measure
brain activity has created the possibility of gaining new insights into
unconscious mental processes, including the workings of the ego, the id,
and the superego. However, neuroscience has also created challenges for
psychodynamic theory, because it has revealed that some traditional
psychoanalytic concepts, such as the notion that the unconscious is
inaccessible to conscious awareness, may be too simplistic (Kihlstrom,
2010). Nonetheless, the integration of psychodynamic theory with
neuroscience has the potential to advance our understanding of mental
processes, personality development, and the treatment of psychological
disorders.</li>

<div id="personality-traits" class="section level3 tabset">
<h3 class="tabset">Personality Traits</h3>
<ul>
<li>The trait approach to personality psychology aims to understand
individual differences in personality by focusing on personality traits,
which are basic dimensions along which people differ.</li>
<li>Traits are thought to be consistent, stable, and reflective of
individual differences.</li>
<li>Gordon Allport and Henry Odbert’s lexical hypothesis guided their
approach to finding the major traits by searching dictionaries for
personality descriptors and using statistical techniques to determine
which words went together.</li>
<li>The goal was to identify the basic dimensions underlying the many
words we use to describe people and reduce the number of traits.</li>
<li>The trait approach has been successful in identifying the
five-factor model or the “big five” traits:
<ul>
<li>Extroversion,</li>
<li>Conscientiousness,</li>
<li>Agreeableness,</li>
<li>Neuroticism, and</li>
<li>Openness to Experience.</li>

<h4>The Five-Factor Model of Personality</h4>

<li>The Big Five or Five-Factor Model of personality is the most widely
accepted system for describing personality traits.</li>
<li>The five traits are Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion,
Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN).</li>
<li>These traits describe stable patterns of behavior that persist over
long periods of time and have broad-ranging consequences for various
areas of life.</li>
<li>For instance, Conscientiousness has been found to predict success in
college, job performance, and health.</li>

<h4>Facets of Traits (Subtraits)</h4>

a person’s personality.</li>
<li>They are, however, considered broad and do not capture the
complexity and specificity of an individual’s behavior and
thoughts.</li>
<li>To address this, lower-level units of personality known as facets
have been proposed.</li>
<li>Facets provide more specific descriptions of a person’s
characteristics and are useful in providing a more nuanced understanding
of an individual’s personality.</li>
<li>Different facets within a trait tend to go together and can be used
to predict how a person might behave in different situations.</li>

<h4 class="unnumbered">The Person-Situation Debate and Alternatives to
the Trait Perspective</h4>
<ul>
<li>The person-situation debate in personality psychology arose from the
publication of Walter Mischel’s book “Personality and Assessment” in
1968.</li>
<li>Mischel challenged the traditional trait perspective of personality
by suggesting that people’s behavior is not consistently consistent
across different situations.</li>
<li>He believed that psychologists should focus on people’s unique
reactions to specific situations rather than studying broad,
context-free traits.</li>
<li>Subsequent research to address this theory showed that on average,
the effect of the situation is about as large as that of personality
traits.</li>
<li>Personality traits still provide an indication of how people will
act on average, but they are not always good predictors of specific
behavior in a given situation.</li>
<li>Most modern personality researchers acknowledge the value of both
broad personality traits and narrower units studied by Mischel.</li>

<h4>Objective Tests</h4>

<li>Are usually highly reliable (i.e., they provide consistent scores
over time).</li>

<li>Limited in their ability to capture the complexity of individual
differences,</li>

personality,</li>
<li>Can be affected by social desirability bias (where people tend to
respond in a way that they believe is socially desirable or acceptable),

<h4>Basic Types of Objective Tests</h4>
<div id="self-report-measures" class="section level5">
<h5>Self-Report Measures</h5>
<ul>
<li>Objective personality tests are widely used to assess personality,
and can be self-administered or performed by a psychologist.</li>
<li>Self-report tests, in which individuals describe themselves, are the
most widely used type of objective test.</li>
<li>They offer advantages such as:
<ul>
<li>cost-effectiveness, and</li>
<li>simplicity and access to a wealth of information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Self-reported personality has been shown to have significant
validity in relation to various important outcomes, such as academic and
job performance, occupational attainment, divorce, and mortality, as
well as links to psychopathology.</li>
<li>Self-reported personality, however, is limited by:
<ul>
<li>The possibility of socially desirable responding,</li>
<li>Self-enhancement bias, and</li>
<li>The reference group effect.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="informant-ratings" class="section level5">
<h5>Informant Ratings</h5>
<ul>
<li>Informant personality ratings are a method of assessing someone’s
personality where the information is gathered from a person who knows
the person being rated well, such as a parent, teacher, spouse, friend,
or boss.</li>
<li>These ratings are particularly useful when self-ratings are not
possible or not reliable.</li>
<li>Informant ratings offer advantages such as:
<ul>
<li>Being based on the informant’s observation of the person’s
behaviour, and</li>
<li>Being less likely to be distorted by defensiveness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Informant ratings can also be limited by:
<ul>
<li>The amount of information the informant has about the person,
and</li>
<li>Are subject to response biases (the reference group effect, and the
tendency for informants to produce overly favourable ratings).</li>

<h4>Other Ways of Classifying Objective Tests</h4>
<ul>
<li>Personality tests differ on two dimensions:
<ul>
<li><em>Comprehensiveness</em> (measure a single attribute (e.g. Toronto
Alexithymia Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), and</li>
<li><em>Breadth of the target characteristics</em> (e.g. California
Psychological Inventory, HEXACO Personality Inventory, Multidimensional
Personality Questionnaire, NEO Personality Inventory-3, Personality
Research Form, 16PF).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are different levels of breadth or generality at which
personality characteristics can be classified.</li>
<li>Some models emphasize broad, “big” traits, while others focus on
more specific characteristics.</li>
<li>Some popular personality instruments assess only broad traits, while
others assess a large number of more specific characteristics.</li>
<li>Some instruments are explicitly designed to provide coverage of both
general and specific trait characteristics.</li>

<div id="projective-and-implicit-tests" class="section level4">
<h4>Projective and Implicit Tests</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Projective</em> tests are based on the belief that
unconscious needs, feelings, and experiences can be revealed by having
people describe or interpret ambiguous stimuli.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of projective tests include the Rorschach Inkblot Test
and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT).</p></li>
<li><p>Projective tests can be cumbersome to administer and score, but
they can provide information about implicit motives that is not easily
obtained from objective measures.</p></li>
<li><p>The TAT has shown significant validity in measuring the need for
achievement, while the validity of the Rorschach has been a matter of
controversy.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Implicit</em> measures of personality are based on the idea
that people form automatic or implicit associations between certain
concepts based on their previous experience and behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>These measures assess the strength of associations between
concepts and can be used to predict behavior, even after controlling for
scores on objective measures of personality.</p></li>

results to date are promising.</p></li>

<div id="behavioral-and-performance-measures" class="section level4">
<h4>Behavioral and Performance Measures</h4>
<ul>
<li>Behavioural measures of personality involve directly observing and
measuring people’s behaviour in natural settings.</li>
<li>This approach offers several advantages, such as avoiding response
biases and studying people in their daily lives.</li>
<li>However, it is more labour-intensive than other methods and
generates a large set of data that must be scored reliably.</li>

transient factors such as a participant’s level of stress, and their
quality of sleep the previous night.</li>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>This chapter provides an overview of social psychology, which
examines how other people influence our lives, thoughts, and
behaviours.</li>
<li>It covers topics such as group processes, social cognition,
conformity, obedience, prejudice, discrimination, and altruism.</li>
<li>The section on social cognition explores how people influence our
thinking and how we simplify our social thinking using various
heuristics.</li>
<li>The chapter also highlights some of the most famous research studies
in conformity and obedience and reviews the controversy surrounding
them.</li>
<li>Finally, the chapter discusses altruism and how it affects our
behaviours towards others.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="an-introduction-to-the-science-of-social-psychology"
class="section level3">
<h3>An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology</h3>
<ul>
<li>Social psychology is the branch of psychological science that
focuses on how the presence of others affects our thoughts, feelings,
and behaviours.</li>
<li>It studies group interactions, cultural influences, and the costs
and benefits of social status, among other psychological processes
involving two or more people.</li>
<li>Social psychology is relevant to our everyday lives because we are
social animals who care deeply about our relationships.</li>
<li>Research has shown that having high-quality relationships is a key
factor in happiness, while feeling lonely or isolated can lead to
depression and physical health problems.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="social-psychology-is-a-science" class="section level3">
<h3>Social Psychology is a Science</h3>
<ul>
<li>The need to belong is the desire for social connections with others
and is rooted in developmental psychology.</li>
<li>It is also relevant to clinical psychology as a lack of belonging
can contribute to loneliness and depression.</li>
<li>In daily life, the distinctions between areas of psychology such as
social, developmental, personality-based, and clinical tend to blend
together, and each has unique approaches to research.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-is-included-in-social-psychology" class="section level3">
<h3>What is Included in Social Psychology?</h3>
<div id="attraction" class="section level4">
<h4>Attraction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Researchers found that when rating the faces of strangers, people
from different ethnicities and cultures agreed on which faces were
better looking and the specific facial features associated with
attractiveness.</li>
<li>When it came to rating the attractiveness of friends, facial
features like skin smoothness and eye size appeared to be less
important. Instead, likeable personality characteristics were a better
predictor of who was considered good looking.</li>
<li>This suggests that while certain physical features are important in
assessing attractiveness, personality traits become more important once
we know a person.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="attitudes" class="section level4">
<h4>Attitudes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Social psychology is a field of psychology that studies how people
interact with and influence each other.</li>
<li>Social psychologists are interested in:
<ul>
<li><em>attitudes</em>,</li>
<li><em>stereotyping</em>,</li>
<li><em>prejudice</em>, and</li>
<li><em>discrimination.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>They study:
<ul>
<li>how people form attitudes,</li>
<li>where these attitudes come from, and</li>
<li>how they change over time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Social psychologists are also interested in ways to make the world a
better place, and they conduct research on attitude change and empathy
towards members of different groups.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="peace-conflict" class="section level3">
<h3>Peace &amp; Conflict</h3>
<ul>
<li>One example is the study by Dov Cohen and his colleagues on people
from a “culture of honour” and their reactions to aggression, which
found that those from honour cultures were more likely to become angry
in response to perceived offence, but did not necessarily act out more
aggressively.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="social-influence" class="section level3">
<h3>Social Influence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Persuasion involves delivering a message to influence behavior in a
desired way, and it is used in various contexts, including advertising
and healthcare.</li>
<li>Research has shown that small acts of kindness, like offering a
small gift, can increase the likelihood of receiving a larger tip.</li>
<li>The principle of <em>reciprocity</em>, which involves the feeling of
needing to give something back when something is received, plays a role
in persuasion.</li>
<li>Policies such as “opt-out” organ donation have been successful in
persuading more people to donate their organs, thereby saving more
lives.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="social-cognition" class="section level3">
<h3>Social Cognition</h3>
<ul>
<li>Social cognition is the way we think about the social world and
perceive others.</li>
<li>Social attribution is when we make educated guesses about the
efforts or motives of others.</li>
<li>The <em>fundamental attribution error</em> is the consistent way we
attribute people’s actions to personality traits while overlooking
situational influences.</li>
<li>This can also occur with groups we belong to versus opposing groups,
where we may attribute negative behavior to the character of the
opposing group while excusing similar behavior by our own group.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Social psychologists study the ways in which people relate to each
other and the impact these relationships have on individuals and society
as a whole.</li>
<li>With the increase in connectivity and diversity in our modern world,
there have been significant shifts in political engagement, ethnic
relations, and family structure.</li>
<li>Social psychology research can lead to practical solutions for
social problems, and can be used by various groups, including lawmakers,
educators, therapists, and policy makers.</li>
