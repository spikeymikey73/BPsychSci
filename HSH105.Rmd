<details>
<summary>LO1: Define 'theory' and its associated concepts</summary>

- Theories are explanations of a natural or social behaviour, event or phenomenon.  
- A scientific theory is a system (based on existing **epistemologies**) of constructs (**concepts**) and **propositions** (relationships between the constructs) that collectively presents a logical, systematic and coherent explanation of a phenomenon of interest within some **assumptions** and boundary conditions.
- Theories offer a strategy to describe, interpret and/or explain a phenomenon, as well as help explain why people do what they do in certain situations

**Epistomologies**: The overall frame of reference that a theorist brings to the study of families. These understandings also outline methods, validity, and scope of knowledge as well as the distinction between justified belief and opinion.

  - *Positivist Epistemology*: posits that there is a single objective truth about families that can be found through systematic research.
  - *Interpretive Epistemology*: posits that there is no single objective truth, but that experiences are relative to a family.
  - *Critical Epistemology*: what counts as knowledge is determined by those in power.

**Assumptions**: the taken-for-granted ideas that scholars believe to be true about families and lay the groundwork for theory building. Each theory has its own set of assumptions.

**Concepts**: Terms and definitions used to explain the theory's framework based on assumptions. Concepts are integral to explaining theories - they provide the building blocks used to create the theory.

**Propositions**: Statements used to apply a theory and test its ongoing validity.
