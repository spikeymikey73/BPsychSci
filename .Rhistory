### LO1
:::{.alert .alert-info}
**Population:** the entire set of individuals, or events, of interest in a particular study (Often not feasible!) **Sample:** set of individuals selected from a population
##### Example:
A psychologist wants to determine whether a motivational program is effective in improving work performance in Australian office workers.
-   Population: Every Australian office worker
### LO2
:::{.alert .alert-info}
**Parameter:** a value that describes a key characteristic of the population, such as:
-   Average income of all Australians
**Statistic:** a value that describes a key characteristic of the sample, such as:
-   Average IQ of a sample of 1000 Australian Uni Students
