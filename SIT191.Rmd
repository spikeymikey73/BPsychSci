**Question 9**
Cats suffering with kidney disease were randomly assigned to diets differing in protein and moisture to see if any diet was more effective in slowing the progression of the disease and allowing the cat to live longer. Measurements of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, potassium and calcium were made before and after the cats followed the diet for three months. The cats were assigned to a protein level diet (13% or 18%) with one third of each protein group given canned food, one third given dry food and the remaining third a mixture of canned and dry food.

Identify the factors in this study, and the levels of each.

- [ ] protein and moisture (1 level each)
- [x] protein (2 levels) and moisture (3 levels)
- [ ] serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, potassium and calcium (1 level each)
- [ ] protein (2 levels) and moisture (1 level)
- [ ] protein (3 levels) and moisture (2 levels)

**Question 10**
Cats suffering with kidney disease were randomly assigned to diets differing in protein and moisture to see if any diet was more effective in slowing the progression of the disease and allowing the cat to live longer. Measurements of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, potassium and calcium were made before and after the cats followed the diet for three months. The cats were assigned to a protein level diet (13% or 18%) with one half of each protein group given canned food and the other half dry food.

Calculate the **mean** (give your answer correct to 2 decimal places).  

**Answer:**  _5.14_

```{r}
Q2 <- c(4.84,5.53,5.33,4.49,5.07,4.80,5.26,5.72,5.25)

Event A is that a malaria death was caused by the *P. vivax* species and event B is the malaria death was in Africa.

- [ ] D. 0.828

c) Are events A and B mutually exclusive?  (1 mark)

- [ ] A. No, because a death can occur from the *P. vivax* species on only one continent
- [x] B. No, because a death can be caused by the *P. vivax* species and be in Africa
- [ ] C. No, because deaths caused by the *P. vivax* species are more likely to occur in Africa
- [ ] D. Yes, because a death can be caused by the *P. vivax* species and be in Africa
- [ ] E. Yes, because a malaria death is caused by only one of the species

[Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places]

**Answer:** 0.020
$$
  p^n = {n \choose n}p^n(1-p)^0\\

**Question 8**

Suppose 72% of adults have travelled overseas.

**If 6 adults are randomly selected, what is the probability that 3 or 4 of them have travelled overseas?**

[Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places]

**Answer:** *0.480*

```{r}
round(dbinom(4, size=6, prob=0.72) + dbinom(3, size=6, prob=0.72), 3)
```



**Question 9**

In a particular rural area of Victoria, 80% of learner drivers pass their driving test on the first attempt.

**If 6 learner drivers are selected, what is the probability of a successful driving test outcome for at least 2 drivers?**

[Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places]

**Answer:** *0.998*

Here it's easier to calculate the probability of none passing, of 1 passing, and then take the complement of this (which includes all outcomes that have 2 or more passing). 

The probability of none passing is

$(1−p)^6$

The probability of exactly 1 passing is

${6 \choose 1}p^1(1−p)^5 = 6p(1−p)^5$

and then subtracting both of these from 1 gives the final answer.

```{r}
1 - (dbinom(0, size=6, prob=0.8) + dbinom(1, size=6, prob=0.8))
```



**Question 10**

For a particular rural area, 81% of learner drivers pass their driving test on the first attempt.  Suppose 130 drivers are randomly sampled from the population.

**How many of the drivers would you expect to pass the test on their first attempt?**

[give your answer to the nearest integer]

**Answer:** *105*

We can assume that each of the drivers selected is close enough to independent and that the number of drivers sampled is less than 10% of the population. Also we have $np > 10$ and $nq > 10$.

Therefore to calculate the mean, we can use $np$.

```{r}
np <- 130 * 0.81
round(np, 0)
```



**Question 11**

A particular airline arrives on schedule 73% of the time.  Suppose an audit which looks at a random 110 flights is conducted.

[give your answer to 2 decimal places]

**Answer:** *4.66*

$$
  = \sqrt{npq}\\
  = \sqrt{110 \times 0.73 \times 0.27}\\
  = 4.66
$$

**Question 12**

A particular airline arrives on schedule 89% of the time.  Suppose an audit which looks at a random 160 flights is conducted. 

**What is the probability that more than 150 of the flights audited would be on time?
Use a _normal approximation_ to the binomial model.**

[give your answer as a decimal to 3 decimal places, e.g. 0.045]

**Answer:** *0.027*

We can assume that each of the flights is close enough to independent and that the number of audited flights is less than 10% of the population. 

Also we have np > 10 and nq > 10.Therefore to calculate the mean, we can use $np$.

$160 \times 0.89 = 142.4$

Then to calculate the standard deviation, we have $\sqrt{npq}
$$
  \sqrt{npq}\\
  160 \times 0.89 \times 0.11\\
  \approx 3.96\\
$$
Then using a normal model, $N(142.4, 3.96)$ we can work out the probability of having a value greater than 150
$$
  z = \frac{150−142.4}{3.96}\\
  ≈1.92
$$


From a z-table, $P(z<1.92) = 0.9726$ and therefore, since we're looking for the probability of **more** than 150 being on time, we calculate $1 - 0.9726 = 0.027$

```{r}
n <- 160
p <- 0.89
q <- 1 - p
sd = sqrt(n*p*q)
testVal <- 150
mean <- n * p
round(1 - pnorm(testVal, mean, sd), 3)
```

People suffering from sacroiliac joint dysfunction can be given a steroid injection to relieve pain.  
After receiving an injection, 15 out of 34 patients reported a reduction in pain.

Calculate the standard error:

[Give your answer to 3 decimal places]

**Answer**: 0.085
$$
\hat{p} = \frac{15}{34} = 0.44117647\\
\hat{q} = 1 - \hat{p} = 0.55882353\\

**Question 1**

Jimmy wants to test the performance of two different pairs of shoes on his running times. Each time he runs, he flips a coin to determine which pair of shoes he's going to wear and then measures the time (in minutes) it takes him to run 10km. He ran wearing Pair 1 on 11 occasions (mean of 42:03, standard deviation of 3:16) and Pair 2 on 13 occasions (mean of 40:29, standard deviation of 4:23). 

What is the value for the **degrees of freedom** (using $n_1 + n_2 - 2$)?

```{r}
  Pair1 <- 11
  Pair2 <- 13
  df <- Pair1 + Pair2 - 2
  print(df)

Is the difference in mean completion times significant?
Using a calculated test statistic value of $t = 4.72$ and $P-value < 0.010$, choose the most correct conclusion (use $\alpha = 0.05$).

- [ ]   Fail to reject $H_0$ since $P-value < 0.05$ – there is evidence that the mean completion time for male rats is longer than that for females
- [ ]   Reject $H_a$ since $P-value < 0.05$ – there is insufficient evidence that the mean completion time for male and female rats is different
- [x]   Reject $H_0$ since the $P-value < 0.05$ – there appears to be a significant difference in the mean completion time for male and female rats
- [ ]   Reject $H_0$ since $P-value > 0.05$ – there appears to be no significant difference in the mean completion time for male and female rats
- [ ]   Fail to reject $H_0 since P-value > 0.05$ – there appears to be no significant difference in the mean completion time for male and female rats
